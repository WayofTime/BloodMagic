# Architect Entry Texts
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.intro.1=My name is Tiberius. I was a kid when the demons came for my village during The Wars. They ransacked the houses and turned the shacks into splinters, wielding fire and water to blast the land asunder. I woke up to some travelling merchants that were passing by, equipping the warriors who were futily trying to drive off the demons that still clawed the village. I was brought to a village nearby, where a magician named Magus helped tend to my wounds. The magic that he used was something that I had never seen before - it wasn't Thaumaturgy, nor Alchemy, and it was definitely not Botany. He winked at me once he saw that my eyes were open, holding his finger to his lips. Fast-forward several years, and I have learned almost everything from Master Magus, being his third student ever to master his arts. Against his wishes, I have recorded my research and put several wards and spells on this book. So welcome, apprentice. I am known as The Architect, and I am a Blood Mage. It took several years of pestering before I managed to convince Magus to teach me. He kept on telling me that, "Magic that uses the life essence of living beings requires patience and preparation in order to master it. One false move, go a little past your natural endurance, and you may find yourself taking a nice vacation in Tartarus." The thing was, I wanted to go there - I had some unfinished business with the demons. The process that Magus originally constructed required powerful artifacts that he constructed himself, but were rather lacking where teaching was concerned. After studying a bit of alchemy and the process of "Equivalent Exchange," I managed to construct myself an altar that would transmute items inside of its basin into new powerful forms. The only issue was that it needed a worthy catalyst, and so with a prick of the finger I set the Blood Altar alight!
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.bloodAltar.1=To start any form of transmutation involving blood, you would need to construct a blood altar and a sacrificial knife, as well as have a solitary diamond in your possession. After placing the blood altar down, Magus advised me to be careful as I filled it slowly with my blood, and said that I would need to be really close to the altar (about a metre) for the knife to work. With about 2 buckets of blood in the altar, which Master Magus reminds me is about 10 hearts worth, I placed the diamond inside of the altar by activating it with the diamond in hand.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.bloodAltar.2=The blood dissipated in a cloud of red swirls as I waited for the atoms of the diamond to shift and reform. There were a few moments where the particles turned gray, which meant that the altar was empty and I had to hurry to fill it. After the diamond burst in a shower of red particles, what finally sat in the altar was a Weak Blood Orb.

# Demon Kin Entry Texts
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.intro.info=我的名字叫贝拉·海泊恩，以恶魔使者的身份被知晓。数个月前我的家乡被一群恶魔侵袭，其他村民全部被杀，房屋全被破坏。我无法记起袭击时的多少细节，除了我所认识的每一个，伴随着痛苦的惨叫而前往一个更美好的世界的人们。庆幸那些恶魔没有听到，那在不容易察觉的教堂的地下室里，畏缩于果篮下的我绝望地避免着自己的尖叫声加入众人的合声。\n 可怕的瞬间，在我不慎撞倒教堂的熏香祭坛时，一只恶魔突然闯入圣所，或许是这圣地的原由又镇静下来。这是只体型庞大的四足怪物，弯曲的獠牙倒悬在突出的嘴上，唾液滴在带有锯齿的剑状爪子。它环顾了四周，我发誓有那么一会它的眼睛和我对上了，但之后它就这么离开这里，仿佛完全没有看到或者听到什么。之后发生的事记忆全都模糊不清。\n 直到第二天才有人经过看到这一切。这一商队看到远处的浓烟，决定绕一大段路好避开这些恶魔。由于我独自一人毫发无损的生存了下来，害怕着这或许是个坏兆头，商队中许多人甚至不想看着我。除了同情着我，尝试着说服商队其他成员也带上我的那对兄弟。卖掉了女祭司之仗与一条盒式挂坠，但我也换到了跟着前往一个远离恶魔破坏路径上的一个安全村庄的许可。
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.snare.info.1=关于世间生灵皆有灵魂，马格斯曾对我讲述了一天：人类，鸡，羊，甚至是爬行者也存在这种给予躯体生之意志的生命力量。似乎马格斯早已在这方面做过大量实验，甚至有闻一个强大的法师，可以将获取这些灵魂并注入一个空的躯体，比如僵尸。但这也让我感到好奇：如果僵尸与骷髅并不拥有灵魂，它们如何拥有这生的意志？是什么，给予他们生气，使他们会去追捕并杀害生灵？ \n 每每钻研最终还是回到了意志的问题上。任何“活物”都必须拥有使之生存下去的意志，但这不意味着那必须是它们自己的。当我把这个想法告诉马格斯的时候他考虑了一会，接着拿出一个黑板和粉笔（从哪？谁知道呢），开始速写并注上一些关于其他形式魔法的注解。 \n “在神秘学中，”他画出一只稻草人的形态并说道，“分配于执行许多简单操作的傀儡被赋予了生气。它们活着，呼吸着，甚至可以死于不再需要它们的主人。在目前历代神秘学中，几世纪以来这门艺术已经有过数个版本，法师会将他们的意志注入那无生命的创造物中，给他们带来生气。\n“那么，贝拉，傀儡是如何运作的呢：通过意志的灌输。” \n 所以如果可以通过他人将其意志注入一个空壳可以使傀儡获得生命，那么就有可能有什么把他们的意志注入亡者的躯体，使得有了僵尸和骷髅的存在。想到这我打了个哆嗦，脑中闪过故乡的遭遇。只有恶魔会做到这么残忍的事。但要检验这个假设，我需要更多证据。
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.snare.info.2=带着马格斯的一些指引，与提比略在他自己工作中抽空出来给予的帮助，我用一些铁锭、线、和一点红石，自己制造出一个原始投网。将神秘学作为跨学科魔法深入学习的提比略，表示这投网应该能够将控制着有生气物体的意志，从目标身上分离出来。“我在玩弄傀儡的时候瞎弄了下这个，”他带着微笑说道，我们都知道这很好的证明了结果是什么。\n “红石似乎中断了傀儡与我的意志的连接使投网移除。从理论上而言，如果有什么控制着僵尸或骷髅，应该能够切断这意志的控制。”\n他告诉我需要做的只要把投网抛出？如果奏效，将会有一段时间从目标飘出白色灰雾。“所以当这发生时你得把目标杀死才能使下一步得以继续。但投网只有25%的几率奏效，所以应该稍微多准备一点。” \n 制作出十六个投网，我带着我的剑在夜间外出。事实上，这还是相当棘手的:我需要追捕数只僵尸，不断躲避它们笨拙的挥舞，同时向它们丢出一些投网。一旦白色颗粒出现，便要迅速杀掉它们并捡起掉离它们身体的东西。少量储于似砂的尘土中蓝色粘稠流体，吸引着我。捡起端详，似乎流体中有这超脱尘俗的“存在”。迅速将样品藏好，决定回家后再作更深的观测。 \n 似乎每个“恶魔意志”的大小和形状都有不同，仿佛意志的质量取决于来源。完全任意地用一个单位于测量，用投网获取的意志似乎于零到五的“意志质量”之间变动。我还不确定我能用这物质做什么，但这仍是相当有趣。我还无法说明这是否为某种恶魔的意志的体现，或着只是它们体内的什么晶体。这还需要更多研究。
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.forge.info.2=Just today, I managed to get a structure that I believed would fuse together items using this raw will. Dubbed the "Hellfire Forge", the structure uses a simple alchemy array carved into the glass on the top of it to fuse up to four items together while injecting it with demonic will. The piece of demonic will is placed on the right-hand side and the four ingredients are placed around the circle. It appears that there are many different "recipes" available in this forge, but there are some gating effects on these. \n\tFor starters, there is a minimum amount of demonic will that has to be in the sample in order for the items to combine � if there isn't enough will in the structure, nothing seems to happen. Next, it seems that although there is a minimum amount of will needed, most of the recipes don't drain the entire sample of its will. Some recipes need a vast amount of demonic will in order to start the process, but only a little bit is used in the crafting, if any at all. Some recipes seem to be very easy to create in large quantities, but others... not so much.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.petty.info.1=I went out on one of my now-daily nighttime adventures in order to harvest some demonic will when I began to realize one of the major problems with the collection method: my bag kept on getting full from all of the samples! For some reason, perhaps because the ultimate source of the demonic will is different for each sample, the will would not compress into a more manageable form. At least the physical manifestation of the will. \n\tThus, I went to work with the hellfire forge that was nestled in my corner of the house, pushing aside some of Tiberius's least unpleasant experiments and getting some raw materials for my own study. One of these days I am going to make Tiberius his own forge, since I am tired of trying to get rid of all of the dust that coats my workplace from his "arcane experiments". I don't care that you are "trying to bridge the gap between the ethereal strands of the Soul Network and the physical construction of the slates", get your damned ash out of my stuff!
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.petty.info.2=Anyway, it did take a while in order to find materials that were most likely to resonate with the demonic will in order to store it in a better manner. Lapis seems to be the most readily available conductor of this energy, acting as a pathway for the will to be channeled. After adding some redstone to act as a shielding from electric fields in the air (adding two energies together seem to cause disastrous effects, at least that is what Magus said), gold as a dampening agent, and glass as a simple housing, I managed to create a very simple "Tartaric Gem". This means "a gem from the underworld, Tartarus."\n\tAfter further tests, I found out that this gem could hold up to a will quality of 64. (When I presented these findings to Magus, he remarked that it seemed like a nice, round number.) When I tried to pick up demonic will afterwards, it seemed to go directly into the gem unless full � after that, the will just seemed to... disappear. Convenient for my backpack, but otherwise a mystery. I also learned that if I hold the gem in my hand and focused (right clicked), about 10%% of the maximum capacity of the gem would flow into other gems I had on my person. I think this last feature is very helpful, especially if we were to find other, more powerful tartaric gems.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.sword.info.1=My snares got tangled again.\n\tIt doesn't seem to matter how much I try to improve the design of them, the rudimentary snare never seems to work perfectly. It just gets tangled most of the time, and when I finally do manage to hit a zombie with it it's more likely to not work than work. In order to stop myself from pulling my own hair out, I went to the forge again and got to work right away.\n\tWell, not right away, since I had to first clean the ash off the top of it again.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.sword.info.2=I infused the demon will-holding capabilities of the petty tartaric gem with an iron sword, and managed to create a blade that... was very dull and hardly did more damage than my fist. I was actually very disappointed with the outcome, because it took a long time of fiddling with the forge so that it would not overheat from the strain of using a petty tartaric gem as its power source.\n\tHowever, as soon as I picked up my Tartaric gem, the sword started to glow with a new energy. It seems that the higher the amount of demonic Will I have on my person, the more damage I seem to do with the sword as well as the more demon will that drops. Whenever you don't have a gem, the Will amount is very... miniscule.\n\tAfter a bit of testing I came to another realization: depending on what I kill, I receive different amounts of Will. It seems proportional to the amount of maximum health that the monster has � a spider, since it has a max health of 8 hearts gives 80%% the health of a zombie, which has 10 hearts. This is probably because these monsters require more Will to animate. I should keep this in mind for later.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.lesser.info.1=I was chatting with Tiberius today, discussing some of the projects that he is working on. I must say, when we start talking about his research it seems that he just keeps going on and on and on! Anyway, one of the recent inventions he wanted to talk about was his sigils: so far he managed to create a Water Sigil and a Lava Sigil, using the Hellfire Forge I finally constructed for him as a means to create them. I wasn't entirely sure how he actually made them � I knew he experimented by taking some ingredients and combining them inside of the forge using the tartaric gem as a catalyst, but I haven't actually seen him actively experimenting yet. Well, I got some insight finally as to what he uses that blasted ash for.\n\tLet's see if I can mimic what he said properly. Ahem. "By using the Demon Will contained inside of these gems to transmute the ingredients, a reaction occurs between things that normally don't do anything when combined. By harnessing this forced synergy, I am able to inscribe several arcane symbols in patterns that will direct the energy that I add myself to perform the desired task." Although it doesn't show well in writing, picture me saying this while pushing glasses up the bridge of my nose. I'm not sure if he's normally like this, but I swear he gets all... science-y when he explains things to me.\n\tAt any rate, he showed me how he created a Water Sigil by demonstrating it to me. After the, admittedly flashy, demonstration, he then got to the meat of the discussion. "When I try to replicate this process with some more advanced materials, it seems that the reagents tend to... explode when added to the alchemy array. They seem very unstable. My thinking is that the ingredients aren't getting properly fused together � perhaps there is not enough energy in the forge to fuse them properly."\n\tAfter thinking about this for a few minutes, I got to work � as I mentioned in a previous entry, I figured that a more powerful Tartaric gem would be required, but I still haven't figured out exactly how I could do this in an elegant way. So, I decided that a brute-force approach would be sufficient for this!
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.lesser.info.2=I took a block of lapis, block of redstone, and a diamond as well as an empty petty Tartaric gem that I had lying around � part of a past experiment that... didn't exactly go very well. All I can say about it is that I am surprised Magus can make holes in a solid concrete wall simply disappear. I then combined these four items in the Hellfire forge with a filled petty Tartaric gem to act as a power source � a minimum of 60 Will seems to be needed. After a bit of effort trying to find an optimal arrangement, I then set them together and watched as the empty Tartaric gem started to grow inside of the forge.\n\tJust as a side note, I tried using a block of gold instead of a diamond to grow the gem, but it seems that having another crystal structure was more beneficial.\n\tThis new, "Lesser Tartaric gem" seems to have a much larger capacity, able to hold a total of 256 raw Will. Hopefully this is enough to sate Tiberius's need for large amounts of Will for a while. But alas it seems that I will need to fill up this gem. Another long night is ahead of me!
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.reactions.info=I woke up in a hospital bed today, aching something fierce. I opened my eyes and saw the dull magenta that made up the ceiling of the "Intense Curse" wing of the hospital in Veteres, which is the closest major city to our village. I wasn't exactly worried by this information: it more so puzzled me that I somehow ended up here while seemingly only covered in scrapes and bruises, plus a simple cast on my left leg. Someone must have cast an "Ossa Fracta" curse on me or something, since all it could be was a simple broken bone! \n\tWhen Magus came in with one of the nurses with a solemn face, I knew it was something more drastic. Apparently, one of my experiments with the new Lesser Tartaric gem rebounded and created a small but forceful explosion. That much I could understand easily enough, but that wasn't it: the mixture of obsidian, iron and diamond that I used coated my lower left leg, forming into a rigid shell that couldn't be removed. The cast that I had on my leg wasn't actually a cast, but some form of runic matrix covering the light-blue shell. \n\tCalmly, I asked what Magus thought, even though I was pretty sure what had occurred. "I think," he said, giving a side-long glance towards the nurse that was listening intently before looking back at me, "that it is simply some sort of residue that is diamond-based, which is the main reason we can't remove it. It is also laced with a bit of... otherworldly energy, which is the main reason that you are here instead of a bed at the local clinic � the Conglomerate is rather stringent about unknown energy directly contacting people, ever since the Eldritch Incident, so we had to make sure that there wasn't any issues."\n\t"I see..." Normally Magus doesn't bother much with formalities such as making sure that the Conglomerate is informed about unknown energies � I've been experimenting with Demon Will for quite a while, and it isn't like the Conglomerate came knocking on our door to have this magic registered. I won't go into much detail here, since I am not well versed in politics, but I know that Magus partakes in it only sparingly. This meant that the power from this Will concerned Magus a lot, perhaps through some of his past dealings...?\n\t"Ah well, enough about that for now," Magus said, rolling up the sleeves of his robes. "I tried to break the shell when I first saw it, obviously after checking what it was. It didn't have an effect last time, but now..."\n\tThere was a searing heat on my left leg, accompanied by a blinding red light as Magus cupped his hands on top of the blue shell. After what felt like an eternity, but what must have been only a couple of seconds, the shell started to crack and fracture, falling apart. Honestly, it was kind of anticlimactic. \n\tI tried to get up, but Magus pushed me back into the bed with a small shove. "Bella, you need to stay and rest. You can work with your research on the gems later." I was initially annoyed, but that soon passed as I had a lot of time to think. The only reason that Magus wasn't able to do the exact same thing earlier was probably because I still had my Tartaric gem on my person after the explosion. So whatever happened to my leg had to be directly tied to the demon Will, and as soon as my gem was taken the shell was able to be removed. It got me thinking...
