# Architect Entry Texts
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.intro.info=Hello, everyone. My name is Tiberius. You can probably tell by this entry that the book is not exactly complete, and you would be right. Because of the 1.7.10 -> 1.8.9 and 1.9.4 (and above) updates, a lot of stuff has changed in the mod. As such, the books have had to be rewritten. Because the ultimate plan for these documents is to have each book in the form of a research journal / actual book, these documents will take a while to flesh out. As such, I am going to be updating this book periodically in order to fill in the necessary gaps. It will start as flavourless garbage to start with (Yeah… not the most appetizing of illustrations to go with for documents, but whatever!), but slowly it will be morphed into a story about a bunch of blood magi on a journey through discovery.\n\tBut enough about that, I need to get into character. *Cough cough*\n\tMy name is Tiberius, and I am a Blood Mage, and also otherwise known as The Architect. This book contains all of my research regarding the ethereal phenomenon called the "Soul Network," as well as the physical properties of some of the most central devices that any Blood Mage in training should be accustomed to. From the art of laying out the structure of a powerful Blood Altar, to the intricacies of sacrificing life force to increase a mage's power, and further to the powers gained through arcane glyphs and sigils, I have discovered, revised, and created new ways into train one's self to new heights.\n\tSo enter, Mage, for a new realm awaits you!\n\t…Yeah, Magus says that I can get a little grandiose, but what can you do?
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.bloodaltar.info.1=The Blood Altar is one of the most central devices in the mod. There are two main uses for the altar: either for crafting certain items essential for progressing through the mod, or for filling up one's Blood Orb. Both of these actions require the player to fill up the basin with Life Essence, which can be extracted from two different sources: monsters and peaceful creatures, and the player's own health.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.bloodaltar.info.2=To add your own Life Essence into the basin, you need to craft yourself a Sacrificial Knife and right click it while next to the altar. This will take a heart of health and add a total of 200LP to the unupgraded altar. "LP" is Life Points, which is a measure of how much life force is used in a task - no, it is not like YuGi-Oh. The Blood Altar has a capacity of 10,000LP. If you then right-click on the altar, you can place an item into the basin, and if it is a valid item the altar will start the crafting process.\n\tThe altar crafts an item by consuming the LP in the basin if the altar is a high enough tier. If there is enough LP, the altar will drain a bit of LP from the basin each tick and increase the progress of the crafting, emitting red particles. If there is no longer any LP in the basin, the altar will emit gray particles and the crafting will start to lose progress, which is not good at all! Finally, if the altar is filling up a Blood Orb, the altar will emit purple particles to indicate it is syphoning LP from the basin.\n\tThere are actually a total of three tanks in the Blood Altar: the main tank, which has a default capacity of 10 kLP as previously indicated, as well as an input tank and an output tank which both have 10%% of the total capacity of the main tank. Every 20 ticks by default, the LP in the input tank will transfer to the main tank at 20LP/s, and the LP in the main tank will transfer to the output tank at 20LP/s. As the names suggest, the input tank accepts the LP that is pumped into the altar acting as a buffer to limit the speed of transferring from outside sources, and the output tank can be pulled from using pipes out of the altar.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.ash.info=Although not strictly part of the overall theme of this book, Arcane Ash is necessary in order to progress through the mod and get some of the more powerful devices available. This ash is crafted using the Hellfire Forge and Demon Will, so if you are new to this concept please consult the "Demon Kin." In essence, this is a way to craft items out of two separate items: a reagent of some sort to act as a catalyst, and a secondary item. \n\tThe ash has a total of twenty uses before you need to craft another. When you right click on the ground (or a wall, though it will only render one direction), you will inscribe a simple circle out of ash. If you click on the ash again with an item, it will be "placed inside of the ash" - assuming that this item is a valid catalyst, the circle will change shape to represent that it is ready for the next item. If it doesn't change shape, then you did something wrong.\n\tOnce it has changed shape, you can then place in the secondary item. If this item matches with the first item, the circle will start rotating and performing different actions depending on the recipe it is working on. After a while, if properly executed, an item will pop out.\n\tAll of the recipes for the Arcane Ash crafting (I call it Alchemy Array Crafting) can be found in JEI by checking the uses for Arcane Ash - the first item shown is the catalyst, and the second item is the secondary item.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.divination.info=The Divination Sigil is one of the most useful tools in the mod, able to tell you many values that will make your life easier. This sigil is crafted using a piece of redstone and a blank slate (crafted in the Blood Altar) using an alchemy array.\n\tWhen you right click a Blood Altar with the sigil, you can see the current tier, amount of LP inside of the main basin, as well as the max capacity of the Blood Altar. Spam-clicking the altar with the sigil will overwrite the previous text from the sigil, meaning that there will not be any spam in your chat.\n\tIf you right click in the air with the sigil, the sigil will tell you the current amount of LP that is in your Soul Network. Although this is rather mundane to start with, this function alone will make it very likely that you will want to keep this sigil on you at all times. 
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.soulnetwork.info=The Soul Network (commonly abbreviated as SN) is the term for the connections between the player and all of the items and structures that they have linked their soul to. When a blood mage becomes more powerful, the strength of their soul increases and thickens these bonds. These connections are ethereal strands of the soul, and only the most powerful of Blood Magi are able to see these in their physical form. To date, no mage has attained this ability...\n\tIn-game, the Soul Network is tied directly to the player. The data is stored inside of the world, and every player has only a single network - the LP placed into the network is not stored in any item, but is instead placed and drawn from a single pool. \n\tTo bind things to your network, the most common way is to simply right click an item that uses a network to power itself. Once bound, the item will indicate that it is owned by you and it can never be unbound (with current technology). If this item is used and it has an LP cost attributed to it, it will take the LP from the owner's network. If there is not enough LP in this network, it will take the missing LP directly from the user's health (not the owner's). Be careful when using items when you have a low amount of LP - it could end up being deadly.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.weakorb.info.1=What good is any mage without a power source? A Blood Orb is a device that consumes physical LP and transfers it into the owner's Soul Network. Although not a battery itself, it does act as a conduit in order to fill up the power reserves of the blood mage. 
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.weakorb.info.2=The Weak Blood Orb is the first such orb that you can make. By infusing a diamond inside of a Blood Altar with 2 kLP, you can create this orb. When bound and placed inside of an altar with some LP in it, the orb will syphon from the basin and transfer that LP directly into the network. Each orb has a maximum capacity that can only be extended by advanced runes on the altar. For the Weak Blood Orb, this maximum capacity is 5 kLP.\n\tBlood Orbs can also be filled directly from the player by simply right-clicking with them - this will transfer a heart of health into the orb and give you 200LP. This cannot increase past the orb's maximum capacity.\n\tA Blood Orb can only be filled by its tier of altar or higher; this means that if you have a T3 orb, it has to be filled in an altar that is greater than T3. A simple T1 altar would not do in this situation.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.incense.info.1=One will quickly find that the speed of LP generation can become increasingly burdensome. Sure, by adding special runes to the Blood Altar you are able to increase the yield of self-sacrificing, but this can be a slow process all the same. If only there was a way to further increase how much LP you can get from yourself?\n\tEnter the Incense Altar. The Incense Altar acts as a central point for a tranquil area, calming the soul itself with the gentle wafts that emanate from the basin. Where this scent comes from you aren't entirely sure, but what could possibly go wrong?\n\tThe goal of this block is to create an area of tranquility to increase how much LP you get from a heart of health. When you are near the block (about five blocks) fire particles will be emitted to show that it is working - when you are affected by this tranquility, your Sacrificial Dagger will transform to indicate that you have an increased yield at the Blood Altar. This process takes about 5 seconds, and you will know you are finished when the fire particles stop appearing. At this point, if you use your Sacrificial Dagger at the Blood Altar you will sacrifice 90%% of your maximum health all at once and pump LP into the altar proportional to the amount of health sacrificed multiplied by a bonus based on how tranquil the surrounding area is: this bonus is +20%% by default.\n\tAs a side note, the Divination Sigil can be used on the Incense Altar to determine the amount of Tranquility as well as how much of a bonus the current altar gives.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.incense.info.2=Of course just an additional 20%% is all well and good, but it can be further expanded by expanding the range of influence of the Incense Altar. If you place a row of three Wooden Path blocks two blocks away from the incense altar in each of the cardinal directions (making sure that all path blocks are on the same y-level, up to five blocks up or down from the incense altar) you can define an area. Any block placed within this area (a block that is the same distance horizontally away from the Incense Altar as the path blocks are horizontally, and on the same level or up to two blocks higher vertically from the path blocks) can add to the Tranquility of the Incense Altar. Another row of path blocks can be added past this initial row following the same rule: the new row must all be on the same y-level as each other, and the entire row has to be within 5 blocks vertically from the previous row of path blocks. This means that layouts such as pyramids, inverted pyramids, or more advanced staircase structures are possible.\n\tAll path blocks have a maximum distance that they can be from the Incense Altar in order to take effect. The Wooden Path blocks are able to work up to a total of three rows from the Incense Altar. Stone paths work up to five, worn stone paths seven and obsidian paths to nine. So at a certain point you have to use better path blocks to extend your tranquility area, however you can use higher tiered path blocks in place of lower tiered path blocks, just not the other way around.\n\tBack to Tranquility. Only certain blocks are able to affect the Tranquility of an area, and there are different types of Tranquility blocks. If you place a crop such as potatoes in the area, you add a bit of Tranquility (using the Crops category). However, if you add another crop like potatoes again or even carrots, you will get less tranquility. Adding something from a different Tranquility category, you get the full effect. But adding more stuff using the same category has diminishing returns. Therefore in order to get the most Tranquility out of a certain area, it is most optimal to mix and match using as many different types of Tranquility as possible.\n\tSome things that add Tranquility are: Crops, logs, leaves, lava, netherrack, farmland, water, Life Essence, and other assorted things.

# Demon Kin Entry Texts
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.intro.info=My name is Bella Highborn, and I am known as the Demon Kin. Several months ago my village was attacked by a wave of demons, killing all other people while destroying every single building. I don't remember much from the attack, other than the screams of pain as each and every person I knew left this world for a happier one. Thankfully the demons did not hear me as I cowered underneath the fruit baskets in the basement of the church of Intactilis, trying desperately to keep my screams from joining the chorus of other voices. \nThere was one horrible moment when I accidentally knocked down the incense altar of the church and a demon came bounding into the sanctuary, unperturbed by what we assumed was a sacred place. It was a huge four-legged monster, with curved tusks hanging past a jutting mouth, saliva dripping onto serrated swords taking the place of his claws. It took a look around the room and I swear it locked eyes with me for a solid second, but then it just simply left as if it neither heard nor saw anything. Everything afterwards was a blur. \nIt was a full day before anyone came to see what happened. A trading caravan saw the smoke in the distance and decided to take the long way around past the demons. Many of the traders didn't even want to look at me, fearing that because I alone managed to survive unscathed it was a bad omen. But two brothers decided to take pity on me and try to convince the rest of the caravan to consider having me ride along. It took me selling the priestess's wand and locket, but I managed to buy safe passage to a village far enough away from the demons' path of destruction. 
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.snare.info.1=Magus was telling me one day that every living being has a soul: humans, chicken, sheep, and even creepers have this life force that would give the body the will to live. It seems that Magus has done a lot of experiments in his time, and has even heard of a powerful mage that could take these souls and transfuse them into empty vessels such as zombies. But that made me wonder: if zombies and skeletons did not have souls, how is it that they had a will to live? What animated them so that they would try to hunt down any living creature and try to kill them? \n\tIt all came back to will, each and every single time. Anything "living" had to have a will in order to survive, but it didn't mean that it had to be their own. When I brought this up to Magus he pondered a little, and then brought out a blackboard and chalk (from where, who knows) and started to sketch some notes about other forms of magic. "In Thaumaturgy," he said while sketching out the form of a straw man, "golems are animated beings that are tasked to perform many mundane operations. They live, breathe, and can even die if they fall out of favour with their masters. In the current iteration of Thaumaturgy, and yes there have been several versions of this art over the centuries, the magician would imbue their will into their inanimate creation and bring them to life.\n\t"That, Bella, is how golems operate: by an imbuement of will."\n\tSo if a golem could live by another entity imbuing its will into an empty shell, maybe some other entity is imbuing its will into the bodies of the dead, bringing zombies and skeletons into existence. At this point I shivered, remembering briefly what happened in my old village. Only a demon could do something so cruel. But to test this hypothesis, I needed more proof.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.snare.info.2=With some direction from Magus, and Tiberius when he could lend a hand from his own work, I made myself a rudimentary snare out of some iron, string, and a bit of redstone. Tiberius, who studied Thaumaturgy in-depth as his cross-discipline magic of choice, said that the snare should be able to disrupt the will of an entity that is controlling an animated object. "I was messing around with this when playing around with golems," he said with a smile. We all knew how well that turned out. "Redstone seemed to disrupt the connection between my golems and my will for them to move. In theory, if something is controlling the zombies or skeletons, you should be able to cut off the will."\n\tHe said that all I needed to do was to throw it - if it worked, some white dust should stream off of the entity for a period of time. "So you have to kill it after this happens in order for anything to really happen. But the snare might only work 25%% of the time, so be slightly liberal with them!"\n\tAfter crafting sixteen of them, I went out with my sword during the night. It was quite tricky, actually: I had to track down several zombies, ducking and dodging their lumbering swipes while chucking a few snares at them. Once the white particles came off of them, I killed them swiftly and picked up what was left of their bodies. A small amount of a blue viscous fluid seemed to lay in the gritty dust, beckoning to me. I picked it up, and it seemed like there was some otherworldly "presence" coming from the fluid. Quickly stowing the samples away, I elected to look at them more deeply when I got back home. \n\tIt seemed that the size and shape of each "Demonic Will" varied, as if the quality of the will depended on the source. Using a completely arbitrary unit of measurement, the Will that I got from the snares seem to range from zero to five "Will Quality". I am not sure what I can use this substance for yet, but it is very intriguing none the less. I can't tell if this is the imprint of the will of some sort of demon, or just a random crystal found in their bodies. More research is needed.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.forge.info.1=I have spent several weeks researching the uses and properties of demonic will. There has been some success these past few days, however it has been infrequent. Tiberius asked me the other day if he could take a sample of demonic will for a few of his other experiments: he mentioned that it might be what he needed to construct a new blood altar to replace the beat-up basin that we were using in Magus's basement, since trying to replicate that old thing with just stone never seemed to create the right... receptacle for our blood magic. In other words, he thinks it may help.\n\tIt hasn't been a complete waste, however! I consulted several different alchemy textbooks discussing "Equivalent Exchange" and the many different ways to manipulate matter. I also talked to a couple of alchemists that were passing by, and they gave me a few tips on how to deconstruct matter and energy in order to study it more closely. (As a side note, I must say I loved the dark purple armour that one alchemist was wearing - just looking at it made me feel like I was being pulled by a dense object. Not talking about Tiberius, either!) From using those simple arrays with the little samples that I had, I managed to see that there were ways to actually tap into the power source inside of the demonic will. I just needed the right configuration.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.forge.info.2=Just today, I managed to get a structure that I believed would fuse together items using this raw will. Dubbed the "Hellfire Forge", the structure uses a simple alchemy array carved into the glass on the top of it to fuse up to four items together while injecting it with demonic will. The piece of demonic will is placed on the right-hand side and the four ingredients are placed around the circle. It appears that there are many different "recipes" available in this forge, but there are some gating effects on these. \n\tFor starters, there is a minimum amount of demonic will that has to be in the sample in order for the items to combine - if there isn't enough will in the structure, nothing seems to happen. Next, it seems that although there is a minimum amount of will needed, most of the recipes don't drain the entire sample of its will. Some recipes need a vast amount of demonic will in order to start the process, but only a little bit is used in the crafting, if any at all. Some recipes seem to be very easy to create in large quantities, but others... not so much.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.petty.info.1=I went out on one of my now-daily nighttime adventures in order to harvest some demonic will when I began to realize one of the major problems with the collection method: my bag kept on getting full from all of the samples! For some reason, perhaps because the ultimate source of the demonic will is different for each sample, the will would not compress into a more manageable form. At least the physical manifestation of the will. \n\tThus, I went to work with the hellfire forge that was nestled in my corner of the house, pushing aside some of Tiberius's least unpleasant experiments and getting some raw materials for my own study. One of these days I am going to make Tiberius his own forge, since I am tired of trying to get rid of all of the dust that coats my workplace from his "arcane experiments". I don't care that you are "trying to bridge the gap between the ethereal strands of the Soul Network and the physical construction of the slates", get your damned ash out of my stuff!
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.petty.info.2=Anyway, it did take a while in order to find materials that were most likely to resonate with the demonic will in order to store it in a better manner. Lapis seems to be the most readily available conductor of this energy, acting as a pathway for the will to be channeled. After adding some redstone to act as a shielding from electric fields in the air (adding two energies together seem to cause disastrous effects, at least that is what Magus said), gold as a dampening agent, and glass as a simple housing, I managed to create a very simple "Tartaric Gem". This means "a gem from the underworld, Tartarus."\n\tAfter further tests, I found out that this gem could hold up to a will quality of 64. (When I presented these findings to Magus, he remarked that it seemed like a nice, round number.) When I tried to pick up demonic will afterwards, it seemed to go directly into the gem unless full - after that, the will just seemed to... disappear. Convenient for my backpack, but otherwise a mystery. I also learned that if I hold the gem in my hand and focused (right clicked), about 10%% of the maximum capacity of the gem would flow into other gems I had on my person. I think this last feature is very helpful, especially if we were to find other, more powerful tartaric gems.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.sword.info.1=My snares got tangled again.\n\tIt doesn't seem to matter how much I try to improve the design of them, the rudimentary snare never seems to work perfectly. It just gets tangled most of the time, and when I finally do manage to hit a zombie with it it's more likely to not work than work. In order to stop myself from pulling my own hair out, I went to the forge again and got to work right away.\n\tWell, not right away, since I had to first clean the ash off the top of it again.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.sword.info.2=I infused the demon will-holding capabilities of the petty tartaric gem with an iron sword, and managed to create a blade that... was very dull and hardly did more damage than my fist. I was actually very disappointed with the outcome, because it took a long time of fiddling with the forge so that it would not overheat from the strain of using a petty tartaric gem as its power source.\n\tHowever, as soon as I picked up my Tartaric gem, the sword started to glow with a new energy. It seems that the higher the amount of demonic Will I have on my person, the more damage I seem to do with the sword as well as the more demon will that drops. Whenever you don't have a gem, the Will amount is very... miniscule.\n\tAfter a bit of testing I came to another realization: depending on what I kill, I receive different amounts of Will. It seems proportional to the amount of maximum health that the monster has - a spider, since it has a max health of 8 hearts gives 80%% the health of a zombie, which has 10 hearts. This is probably because these monsters require more Will to animate. I should keep this in mind for later.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.lesser.info.1=I was chatting with Tiberius today, discussing some of the projects that he is working on. I must say, when we start talking about his research it seems that he just keeps going on and on and on! Anyway, one of the recent inventions he wanted to talk about was his sigils: so far he managed to create a Water Sigil and a Lava Sigil, using the Hellfire Forge I finally constructed for him as a means to create them. I wasn't entirely sure how he actually made them - I knew he experimented by taking some ingredients and combining them inside of the forge using the tartaric gem as a catalyst, but I haven't actually seen him actively experimenting yet. Well, I got some insight finally as to what he uses that blasted ash for.\n\tLet's see if I can mimic what he said properly. Ahem. "By using the Demon Will contained inside of these gems to transmute the ingredients, a reaction occurs between things that normally don't do anything when combined. By harnessing this forced synergy, I am able to inscribe several arcane symbols in patterns that will direct the energy that I add myself to perform the desired task." Although it doesn't show well in writing, picture me saying this while pushing glasses up the bridge of my nose. I'm not sure if he's normally like this, but I swear he gets all... science-y when he explains things to me.\n\tAt any rate, he showed me how he created a Water Sigil by demonstrating it to me. After the, admittedly flashy, demonstration, he then got to the meat of the discussion. "When I try to replicate this process with some more advanced materials, it seems that the reagents tend to... explode when added to the alchemy array. They seem very unstable. My thinking is that the ingredients aren't getting properly fused together - perhaps there is not enough energy in the forge to fuse them properly."\n\tAfter thinking about this for a few minutes, I got to work - as I mentioned in a previous entry, I figured that a more powerful Tartaric gem would be required, but I still haven't figured out exactly how I could do this in an elegant way. So, I decided that a brute-force approach would be sufficient for this!
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.lesser.info.2=I took a block of lapis, block of redstone, and a diamond as well as an empty petty Tartaric gem that I had lying around - part of a past experiment that... didn't exactly go very well. All I can say about it is that I am surprised Magus can make holes in a solid concrete wall simply disappear. I then combined these four items in the Hellfire forge with a filled petty Tartaric gem to act as a power source - a minimum of 60 Will seems to be needed. After a bit of effort trying to find an optimal arrangement, I then set them together and watched as the empty Tartaric gem started to grow inside of the forge.\n\tJust as a side note, I tried using a block of gold instead of a diamond to grow the gem, but it seems that having another crystal structure was more beneficial.\n\tThis new, "Lesser Tartaric gem" seems to have a much larger capacity, able to hold a total of 256 raw Will. Hopefully this is enough to sate Tiberius's need for large amounts of Will for a while. But alas it seems that I will need to fill up this gem. Another long night is ahead of me!
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.reactions.info=I woke up in a hospital bed today, aching something fierce. I opened my eyes and saw the dull magenta that made up the ceiling of the "Intense Curse" wing of the hospital in Veteres, which is the closest major city to our village. I wasn't exactly worried by this information: it more so puzzled me that I somehow ended up here while seemingly only covered in scrapes and bruises, plus a simple cast on my left leg. Someone must have cast an "Ossa Fracta" curse on me or something, since all it could be was a simple broken bone! \n\tWhen Magus came in with one of the nurses with a solemn face, I knew it was something more drastic. Apparently, one of my experiments with the new Lesser Tartaric gem rebounded and created a small but forceful explosion. That much I could understand easily enough, but that wasn't it: the mixture of obsidian, iron and diamond that I used coated my lower left leg, forming into a rigid shell that couldn't be removed. The cast that I had on my leg wasn't actually a cast, but some form of runic matrix covering the light-blue shell. \n\tCalmly, I asked what Magus thought, even though I was pretty sure what had occurred. "I think," he said, giving a side-long glance towards the nurse that was listening intently before looking back at me, "that it is simply some sort of residue that is diamond-based, which is the main reason we can't remove it. It is also laced with a bit of... otherworldly energy, which is the main reason that you are here instead of a bed at the local clinic - the Conglomerate is rather stringent about unknown energy directly contacting people, ever since the Eldritch Incident, so we had to make sure that there wasn't any issues."\n\t"I see..." Normally Magus doesn't bother much with formalities such as making sure that the Conglomerate is informed about unknown energies - I've been experimenting with Demon Will for quite a while, and it isn't like the Conglomerate came knocking on our door to have this magic registered. I won't go into much detail here, since I am not well versed in politics, but I know that Magus partakes in it only sparingly. This meant that the power from this Will concerned Magus a lot, perhaps through some of his past dealings...?\n\t"Ah well, enough about that for now," Magus said, rolling up the sleeves of his robes. "I tried to break the shell when I first saw it, obviously after checking what it was. It didn't have an effect last time, but now..."\n\tThere was a searing heat on my left leg, accompanied by a blinding red light as Magus cupped his hands on top of the blue shell. After what felt like an eternity, but what must have been only a couple of seconds, the shell started to crack and fracture, falling apart. Honestly, it was kind of anticlimactic. \n\tI tried to get up, but Magus pushed me back into the bed with a small shove. "Bella, you need to stay and rest. You can work with your research on the gems later." I was initially annoyed, but that soon passed as I had a lot of time to think. The only reason that Magus wasn't able to do the exact same thing earlier was probably because I still had my Tartaric gem on my person after the explosion. So whatever happened to my leg had to be directly tied to the demon Will, and as soon as my gem was taken the shell was able to be removed. It got me thinking...
