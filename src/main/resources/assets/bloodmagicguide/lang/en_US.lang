# Ritual Master Entry Text
guide.BloodMagic.entry.ritual.intro.info=Good evening. My name is Magus Arcana. I have had many guises over the years: a thief and a vigilante, a wizard and a warrior, a roaming nomad and even a politician. The title that I hold nowadays is one that many cannot comprehend, that at the very mention of it brings forth images of brutality that in some cases have been earned but in many others are misguided. I am of course talking about being a Blood Mage, though my friends simply call me Magus whereas my enemies refer to me as The Ritual Master.\n\tMy students have been pestering me for many months now, attempting to get me to document all of the myriad adventures that I have had in some form of book for me to distribute among any aspiring mages. I had been resistant, but it was Tiberius who put it best: "Although you may not see the value of it yourself, hearing the intricacies of any sort of craft from a man who has achieved mastership of the field will prove invaluable for future generations. It doesn't matter how accurately someone else retells it, if you don't have the utmost confidence in a source the gold sand could be nothing more than sulfur." You could tell he was delving into a bit of alchemy at that point, but since he was my first student for a long time I tend to value his opinion.\n\tSo, aspiring Blood Mage, training in the arcane that many yet do not fully understand, lend me your ears for these are words worth heeding: the field that you are studying has many aspects, and without careful consideration you may find your tools lacking. Therefore make sure to review this book often - I have put many enchantments on the tome that you carry with you so that whenever I write in my master copy the words will change for you.\n\tSo sit back, relax, and enjoy the teachings of a very old man. You may learn more than you've bargained for.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.ritual.basics.info=Modern day rituals are a lot different from those that were conducted centuries past. There was a time when people would inscribe arcane constructs out of dust on the ground and dance around until they got what they wanted. I even remember one hermit witch who gathered energy from her garden. I laughed at it all until she sicced her pet owl on me. \n\tThe rituals that Blood Mages use require the precise alignment of marked stones to focus and transform the power that a mage pumps into it. One day, my apprentice Tiberius was rummaging through some of the old artifacts that I had procured over the years in the closet of his new room. There was a vial of liquid Etherium that I haven't touched in ages (I was meaning to get back to that, but I haven't had any time) as well as a crystal ball that always seemed to say "Tuesday" when you peered through the glass. When one of the boxes that was labeled "Runic Dust" was knocked over a small red gem tumbled out and knocked against Tiberius's foot. Immediately a bright ruby light emanated from it and reacted with the dust in the box that he was carrying.\n\tNaturally, an explosion occurred.  The unfocused energy that Tiberius inadvertently released through the gem sparked the runic dust and stones around him, and without a means of containing the power it simply was pushed outwards. After a few days in the medical ward, Tiberius and I started to get to work.\n\tThrough a mixture of several sleepless nights and a hardy helping of caffeine (I've really got to thank Mister Player for the coffee supply, I salute your efforts for a more awake tomorrow!) we eventually perfected the key ingredients for all rituals.\n\tThrough our experimentation, we learned that we needed four different things: we needed a bunch of ritual stones placed around an area in a set pattern, a few different inks that are applied to the ritual stones to help further specify the pattern, a central ritual stone that acts as a central conduit of power, and a crystal that activates the ritual. I think it's best to talk about these one by one.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.ritual.ritualStone.info.1=The Ritual Stone acts as a simple receptacle for magical energy, shaping it and further redirecting it in different ways depending on how the stone is configured. When you start off, there are five different stones that you have access to: Blank (the base stone that does not have any markings applied), Water, Fire, Air, and Earth. Every single ritual will have a number of these, and depending on how they are arranged around the Master Ritual Stone the overall effect will be different.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.ritual.ritualStone.info.2=In order to inscribe the correct symbols onto the ritual stones you must have a set of inscription tools. I have since developed a method for people to more easily apply the correct inks to the ritual stones while placing them in the correct configuration, but if one were to wish to do this manually they can use these tools. When you activate a ritual stone with one of the inscription tools in your hand (right clicking on the stone) you will apply some ink to the stone, changing it to the same type as the tool. In early tiers, you only have access to the base four colours, however once you become more powerful you will have more tools at your disposal.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.ritual.masterRitualStone.info=As with most magics, without a guiding force the effect of the ritual will either become uncontrollable or simply will not work at all. Thus, in order to control the rituals a Master Ritual Stone is required (I usually abbreviate this to "MRS" in my notes, but saying it in public is a little awkward. "I need more mrs please!"). The MRS takes in power from the owner's Soul Network and pushes it through the ritual stones, thus performing the ritual. \n\tAttaching the Soul Network to a large stone that we don't hold in our hands proved to be a bit tricky. I managed to do this one time by meditating on top of the stone in the lotus position, focusing my power through the stone and trying to link the tendrils of my network into the inner workings of the ritual. Although I got it working for a few minutes, all I was really awarded was a pair of wet pants as water condensed onto the ritual stones. I've learned to not meditate on any of my experiments again. 
guide.BloodMagic.entry.ritual.activationCrystal.info.1=Instead of waiting an hour at a time to meditate a ritual active, we took the red gem that fell out of the box originally and started to analyze it. Tiberius was certain that it had the ability to "establish links between the corporeal realm of our reality and the incorporeal essence that is the manifested Soul Network." Sometimes I wonder if it was a good idea to have him become my apprentice, but it is times like these that I see his knack for the more arcane aspects of magic. Oh, I should probably write what he meant in English: by using this crystal, we could link our soul networks to the Master Ritual Stone in order to supply it with energy.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.ritual.activationCrystal.info.2=Thus we had ourselves a Weak Activation Crystal and a means in which to recreate its structure. The main ingredient for the crystal is another crystal that can be linked to my Soul Network: a Lava Crystal. Then, by quickly inscribing some instructions onto the crystal's surface the Blood Altar can do the rest of the work to transmute it into an activation crystal. Naturally, this crystal has to be bound to the user's soul network in order to function. When the ritual's stones are laid correctly around the MRS, the user should touch the activation crystal to the MRS and push out enough energy to jump start the ritual in question. If you have enough LP inside of your Soul Network the ritual will activate. If you do not, or if the stones are not laid out correctly, the ritual will simply not activate and no LP cost is incurred. 
guide.BloodMagic.entry.ritual.diviner.info.1=After discerning the size and layout of many rituals I started to find it a little bothersome to continually consult my notes in order to build the rituals. That is why I worked to create a device that would allow anyone to simply place down the stones in the correct position through simple gestures and movements. I've placed this entry further up the list chronologically because it is best for people to learn of this item before starting with the actual construction of rituals. Otherwise they may find out that they don't have everything they need, or will summon a meteor from hell instead of a fresh bottle of spring water.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.ritual.diviner.info.2=The Ritual Diviner is essentially an encyclopaedia for rituals. By cycling through the diviner (shift-left click and shift-right click) you can select a different ritual from its store of knowledge. Gazing into the diviner will also tell you some simple information about the ritual. If you have Ritual Stones on your person and you touch the diviner onto the MRS (right click) you can place a stone for the ritual you want to construct. Doing this enough times will net you a completed ritual!
guide.BloodMagic.entry.ritual.fullSpring.info=A few years ago a travelling merchant stopped by the village near my house, peddling his wares to all who were willing to part with their coin. There was a drought at the time and the crops were dying, so the merchant brought forth a silver talisman with a blue gem set inside of it. "This, my friends," he said with great zeal, "will make sure that your rivers will not dry out! By using alchemy I can bring forth water from the very air!"\n\tUnfortunately for the village it seemed that the gem was a simple piece of sapphire, and before anyone realized that they were tricked he was already several miles away. I tend to not intervene in the affairs of the village because they tend not to like my magic, but in this case I made an exception. After I had a lovely chat with the "alchemist," I spent a few hours meditating near the irrigation channels. By condensing the water vapour in the air I managed to create enough water to keep the crops watered until the next downfall. This wasn't exactly an efficient method and I was drained for the next few days, using some of the water from the channel to rehydrate myself.\n\tRemembering this, I employed the same principles to create the Ritual of the Full Spring. By channeling a small amount of energy into the ritual, it condenses the moisture in the air around it to produce a source of water on top of the master ritual stone. The cost to activate the ritual is fairly insignificant, and the maintenance even more so.  \n\tThe water's range can be expanded by using the ritual tinkerer and even placed in a different location, so one does not need to worry about where a ritual is placed if they are worrying about aesthetics. The miracles of magic!
guide.BloodMagic.entry.ritual.lava.info=Lava, perhaps one of the most rudimentary power sources. I tend not to use it much in my own research because it can be a little difficult to work with - it's not like you can use a simple iron bucket to pick some up! \n\tOne of the local tinkerers came by my house one day asking me if there were any sources nearby since they recently acquired some new hardware that they needed to power. I said that there were a few but most of them were already owned, but I decided to come to his place to look at the contraption.\n\tIt was a smeltery at least 5 metres high and just as wide, hooked up to several tanks that stood empty and barren. Although I wasn't entirely sure on how it operated I could tell that the raw heat of lava would be perfect for it - electricity would work well if it was modified correctly, but I could tell this wasn't from Immersive Industries. \n\tAfter a small chat with the tinkerer money changed hands and I asked him to stand back as I prepared my ritual stones. To enact what I wished I took four fire stones and arranged them in a cross around the master ritual stone and then pushed hard with my activation crystal while imagining the process in my head. In theory, it should be simple: take some rocks from deep in the earth and compress them with some energy, causing them to melt under the intense pressure and turn molten. This lava could them be retrieved off of the ritual stone and the process can be repeated.\n\tWhile simple in theory, in practice it was a little difficult. For my simple network at the time, the activation cost was quite steep because of the initial pressure required, and the drain for each source of lava was not something I was prepared for. (20000 LP to activate, 500 LP per source block)\n\tI staggered out of the building with a grin on my face, however: the tanks were full of lava, enough to keep the tinkerer in business for a couple fortnights until he could procure a more permanent source of lava. I made sure to pick up my ritual stones after I finished, though. \n\t----------\n\tWith no modifications to the ritual, the ritual will attempt to place a source of lava on the block directly above itself at a cost of 500 LP every tick if there is room, displacing liquids if they are flowing. This placement range, by default, can be expanded to a maximum of 9 blocks at a maximum distance of 3 away from the ritual.\n\tBy augmenting the ritual with Raw Will, the LP cost will decrease in proportion to the Will that is in the Aura, consuming Will proportional to the amount of LP that is saved. Using this Will can also grant the ability to place lava directly into a block's internal tanks, at a rate comparable to normal ritual operations.\n\tCorrosive Will causes the ritual to invert the invincibility granted from fire immunity, causing all entities that are immune to fire within a set area to be damaged severely based on the amount of Will in the Aura. Those that are not immune to fire are unhurt by this effect.\n\tWhen Vengeful Will is applied to the ritual, a volatile gas is released and causes all non-player entities within its specified range to be affected by Fire Fuse. When the timer of the debuff goes to 0, the entity will explode, forcefully propelling them into the air with explosive force.\n\tDestructive Will increases the maximum range and volume that the ritual may influence. The more Will you have, the more lava blocks that can be placed by a single ritual. Thankfully, the ritual does not drain any Destructive Will, however if your Will drops and the ritual's maximum range is lower than what you set it at, the ritual will not work at all until fixed.\n\tFinally, Steadfast Will grants all players within its range a Fire Resistance buff, whose time applied and cost in Will is affected by the amount of Will in the Aura. Careful note should be taken, because if you are affected by Fire Resistance you can be damaged by the ritual's Corrosive effect.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.ritual.greenGrove.info=Last week I started to teach Tiberius his cross-disciplinary magic. Every apprentice that I have had has had to learn another form of magic while learning Blood Magic. It doesn't matter much which one they choose as long as it does not consume some form of finite resource - I used to employ a form of magic from the Ars clan from the far East, but since the world's source of Etherium was consumed into scarcity it died out long ago. \n\tTiberius decided to learn Thaumaturgy, which employs using the magic of the world to perform your magic. This is a good counterbalance to Blood Magic, which uses the magic of life. As such, these magics use different means to perform the same tasks. To demonstrate I decided to highlight the differences to Tiberius when it comes to crop growth.\n\t"Thaumaturgy uses a growth catalyst that is fueled by the essentia Herba," I state while pointing towards the Essentia Flowchart that was pinned to the classroom wall. Sure, Tiberius was sitting at the only desk there, but sometimes a guy has to have some fun. "A small trickle of Aura and this essentia stimulates the photosynthetic process of the plant, encouraging it to grow by giving it more solar energy. This process requires that the soil is well fertilized, or else the crop can simply wither and die."\n\tI then take four earth and water ritual stones and place them in a circle around a master ritual stone. "Conversely, Blood Magic uses a different process." While speaking, I activate the ritual and cover it with some simple dirt. "By using your life force or the energy of animals, you can fertilize the plants in such a way that they don't need as much fertilizer. In essence, it force-feeds the plants so that they always have a high concentration of nutrients."\n\tI throw a few seeds onto the dirt and cover them slightly, uncorking and emptying a vial of water from inside my robes. "This process doesn't need any extra sunlight, because it uses a different source of energy. Though it does work much better when there is some light - the plant isn't exactly used to these sorts of conditions!"\n\tA few shoots have already poked their leaves out of the dirt while I was explaining, seemingly waving in response. I felt the mild strain on my body as each new leaf sprouted, minor each time but when accumulated it started to stack up. Once I finished the class I cleared up the dirt from the experiment and decided to have a nice stroll to the village: I had a bushel of wheat that needed selling. \n\t----------\n\tThe Ritual of the Green Grove, as the name may suggest, accelerates the rate of growth of plants that are nearby. By using the player's blood as a rich fertilizer, it will attempt to grow anything that it deems as a plant, such as wheat and carrots, growing anything within its range periodically. Through default operations, the ritual will look at the 3x3 area two blocks above itself and attempt to grow each block with a 30%% success rate every second. If manipulated with the Ritual Tinkerer, the ritual can handle a maximum of 81 crops at a time within a 5 block radius of the MRS. As another note\n\tWhen augmented with Demon Will, there are several effects that can be obtained. If Raw Will is used, the ritual will perform all operations at an accelerated rate, consuming 0.05 Will per successful growth and increasing its speed relative to how much Will is in the Aura.\n\tIf infused with Vengeful Will, the ritual will consume 0.05 Will per successful growth and will increase the chance that a given operational tick will be successful on the plant. By default without Will it is 30%%, but for instance if you have 100 Vengeful Will the rate will increase to 80%%.\n\tDestructive Will increases the effective maximum range of the ritual, meaning the more Will you have the more crops/plants a single ritual can handle. Thankfully, the ritual does not drain any Destructive Will, however if your Will drops and the ritual's maximum range is lower than what you set it at, the ritual will not work at all until fixed.\n\tSteadfast Will grants the ability to set an area around the ritual that will be automatically tilled and hydrated. Additionally, any seed that is within this range will be planted on a nearby block if possible. This costs a small amount of Steadfast Will, and its effects do not scale with Will in the Aura.\n\tWhen Corrosive Will is used in the ritual, the fundamental nature of the ritual may shift. When supplied and the new range is properly set, any mobs that enter in the ritual's area of influence will have the "Leech" effect applied. Every few ticks, the plants near the mobs will be damaged and the mob will be damaged proportionally. Fertilizing with mobs directly can prove beneficial! Every 10 seconds that the debuff is applied per mob, 0.2 Corrosive Will will be consumed.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.ritual.magnetism.info=The Ritual of Magnetism is the bread and butter of anyone who enjoys quarries. The ritual creates a revolving magnetic field, pulling up the rich ores from the ground underneath it and placing the contents in its area. This does not displace any rock, so no gaping holes will appear in the land - assuming that the land isn't made up entirely of ore. The ritual operates once every 40 ticks and costs 50LP per successful operation.\n\tThe default radius that this ritual operates is 3 blocks in each cardinal direction, giving an area of 7x7 blocks centered on the MRS. Because the ritual currently does not have any Will augments, you can only increase the radius of effect for the ritual by placing a valuable block directly underneath the MRS. If an iron block is used the radius becomes 7. If a gold block is used, the radius becomes 15. Finally, if a diamond block is used the radius expands to 31, meaning any ores below the ritual in a 63x63 area will be slowly pulled up into its 3x3x3 volume above the MRS.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.ritual.crusher.info=The Ritual of the Crusher's operation is rather simple. The ritual needs to have some form of inventory linked to it, which when unaltered simply sits on top of the MRS. While in operation, the ritual will look inside of its crushing range (by default the 3x3x3 area below the ritual) and break one block at a time at a rate of once every 2 seconds at the cost of 7 LP per successful operation. The broken blocks will then be transferred to the linked inventory - if there is no room for the items, they will instead be spewed on top of the chest.\n\tWhen fueled with Raw Will, the ritual will work at a faster rate based on the total amount of Will in the Aura. While sped up, it will consume 0.05 Raw Will per successful operation.\n\tDestructive Will causes blocks that are broken by the ritual to have Fortune applied to it. Currently the fortune level does not vary and is instead level 3 regardless of the Will amount. This will consume 0.2 Will per successful operation, regardless of whether it was useful.\n\tSteadfast Will will instead cause blocks to be broken with the Silk Touch effect. This costs 0.02 Will per operation, and will override the Destructive effect where possible.\n\tCorrosive Will makes it so that blocks that are broken by the ritual will be processed with some form of cutting fluid. This means that for instance if it is an iron block the result will be two pieces of iron sand. The current "cutting fluids" that the ritual uses are: Basic Cutting Fluid and Explosive Powder. The ritual consumes a different amount of Will based on what was used, and will only consume the Will if the effect applies. This overrides Silk Touch where applicable.\n\tVengeful Will causes it so that when a successful operation takes place the inventory has its contents compressed similar to the Sigil of Compression: if there is 65 redstone dust inside of the chest, one block of redstone will be crafted and 56 dust will remain. Will is only consumed when this is successful, and it costs 0.2 Will.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.ritual.highJump.info=This ritual uses a huge burst of air to propel all those who walk on top of it into the sky. What is more, if the user lands in the ritual's area of effect they will not suffer any fall damage. Players who sneak inside this ritual also are not affected.\n\tThe ritual costs 5LP per entity per tick of successful operation, so it won't cost anything if it doesn't fling people in the air.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.ritual.speed.info=As the name may suggest, the Ritual of Speed is used for transportation of various sorts. The ritual may be placed in the direction of any of the cardinal directions and any entities within its range will be launched in the direction that the ritual is pointing. When looking at a ritual, this direction is where the dusk ritual stone is. By default, the ritual has a radius of 2 blocks from the MRS, though this can be expanded or contracted when using a ritual tinkerer. This will apply a speed of 3 blocks/tick in the direction of the ritual and 1.2 blocks/tick vertically.\n\tIf the ritual is fueled with Raw Will, the speed of the ritual is increased substantially based on the Will that is in the Aura. For instance, the speed will be doubled if there is 100 Will inside of the Aura. For each successful operation, 0.1 Will is consumed.\n\tVengeful Will prevents the ritual from moving adult mobs, and Destructive Will prevents the ritual from moving child mobs. If either one of these are used, players are also prevented from using the ritual. If both of them are used, however, the effect is that only players may use the ritual and mobs cannot. These augmentations can be used effectively for sorting animal farms or even getting rid of those pesky child zombies in your sacrificial pen. The ritual will consume 0.05 Will for each type that is in effect on successful operation, so if a child enters the ritual space when you use Destructive Will it will not cost Will or LP.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.ritual.wellOfSuffering.info=For those of you who prefer to use mobs instead of your own health, the Well of Suffering damages all living non-player entities in a 10 block radius and places the health in a connected altar. The ritual will look for a blood altar within its range, checking 5 blocks horizontally and 10 blocks vertically unaltered. When it finds an altar, it will store its location internally - if there isn't an altar nearby, the ritual will not work. The ritual will deal 1 HP per entity and place 25 LP into the altar (100 for peaceful animals), which can be augmented with Sacrifice runes. 
guide.BloodMagic.entry.ritual.featheredKnife.info=The Ritual of the Feathered Knife taps into the user's body, draining away their life force in order to fill a blood altar nearby. The ritual will look for a blood altar within its range, checking 5 blocks horizontally and 10 blocks vertically unaltered. When it finds an altar, it will store its location internally - if there isn't an altar nearby, the ritual will not work. When a player then enters within the ritual's damage range, which by default is a radius of 15 blocks horizontally and 20 blocks vertically, the ritual will damage the player for 1HP and then place that health into the connected altar directly (respecting blood runes). There are some safety mechanisms on the ritual, which cause it to not work on a player with less than 30%% of their max health. Unaugmented, the ritual does this once every second.\n\tThere are a few useful augmentations that you can use if you use Demon Will. If Raw Will is consumed by the ritual, the ritual will attempt to damage players within its range at a faster rate, operating twice per second. The ritual will consume 0.05 Raw Will per successful operation.\n\tIf you have more than 10 Steadfast Will in the Aura, the ritual will increase its safety threshold and instead will not work on players with less than 70%% health. This function currently does not consume Will.\n\tIf you have more than 10 Vengeful Will in the Aura, the ritual will remove some of its safety limitations, causing it to work on players until they only have 10%% of their maximum health left. If the ritual also has Steadfast Will augmented onto it the threshold will still be 70%% for the owner of the ritual only. This function currently does not consume Will.\n\tWhen Destructive Will is applied to the ritual, the ritual becomes a lot more efficient with its HP to LP conversion. The amount of LP that is added to the altar per health point increases based on the Will in the Aura, up to a maximum of +20%% for 100 Destructive Will. This effect stacks multiplicatively with runes, Living Armour Upgrades, and Incense. This consumes 0.05 Destructive Will per HP sacrificed.\n\tSpeaking of incense, if Corrosive Will is used in the ritual the ritual will respect the effects of incense on you. If you do not have the Soul Fray debuff on and you are empowered by an Incense Altar, the ritual will consume all of your HP up to the set threshold and pump all of the resultant LP into the altar. It will also remove the incense that you incurred and apply Soul Fray onto you. This effect stacks with the Destructive Will buff.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.ritual.regen.info=Arguably one of the best rituals for any potential Blood Mage who wishes to use his own life force to fuel his magic, the Ritual of Regeneration casts a veil of energy around itself, healing entities that find themselves within its range. Every 2.5 seconds the ritual will cast Regeneration I on living entities in its 15 block radius, costing 100LP per player and 10LP per other living entities for the 2.5 seconds of regen. \n\tIf Corrosive Will is used to augment the ritual a second range will be available, a "vampiric range". Any non-player entities within this range will be randomly damaged in order to directly heal players within the regular healing range. This costs 0.04 Will to use and will transfer 1HP per operational tick.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.ritual.harvest.info=This ritual will seek any harvestable plant block within its range (default is the 9x9x5 high area above the MRS) and try to harvest it, replanting any seeds if the plant can drop seeds. All of the drops from the plant will appear where the plant was harvested. The ritual will attempt to harvest plants once every 5 ticks and will cost 20LP per successful operation.\n\tPlants that can be harvested include, but are not limited to: pumpkins, wheat, carrots, potatos, nether wart, cactus, reeds. Keep in mind that the ritual makes no assumptions about the thing it is harvesting - it can only harvest mod-added crops if the mod in question registers a harvesting handler with the mod.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.ritual.interdiction.info=Based on an archaic alchemical device of legend, the Ritual of Interdiction attempts to forcibly push all non-player mobs away from the center of the ritual. By default, all mobs that are within two blocks of the MRS are pushed away from the MRS by setting their velocity. It should be noted that mobs within this range are not affected by fall damage, though that safety net wares off as soon as they are pushed away. 
guide.BloodMagic.entry.ritual.containment.info=The opposite of Interdiction, the Ritual of Containment attempts to pull mobs within its area of effect towards the space above the MRS, suspending them in the air where they cannot move. The default range of the ritual is a 3 block horizontal radius from the bottom of the master stone to the top of the top-most runes, though this range can of course be altered.\n\tThis ritual costs 1LP per mob pulled every tick.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.ritual.suppression.info=The Dome of Suppression "suppresses" all liquids in a set radius, able to temporarily replace fluids in a hemisphere with a 10 block radius with air. If the ritual is turned off, this fluid will return in the same state it was before. This costs 2LP per operational tick.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.ritual.expulsion.info=If you play on a server you can face a situation where you have unwanted player visitors. Sometimes force fields and giant bloody rotors are not enough of a deterrent and they still manage to get into your base. This ritual attempts to alleviate this through the use of teleportation magic!\n\tIf a player that is not the owner enters the range of the ritual (default 12 block radius) the ritual will teleport the player randomly within a radius of 100 blocks away. However, if there is a chest on top of the MRS with a bound item from a player that player will be exempted from the teleportation, acting effectively like a whitelist.\n\tThe ritual costs 2000LP per successful teleportation.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.ritual.zephyr.info=Modelled after an ancient sword of proverb, the Call of the Zephyr uses the power of wind to collect the items that are around it and place them inside of the linked chest (default is right above the MRS). This is done instantly, meaning that the items are teleported directly into the inventory - no need to worry about weird suction effects!\n\tThe default item radius is 5 blocks away from the MRS.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.ritual.laying.info=As many are aware, being able to place blocks can be important in various automation tasks. This ritual takes the items/blocks from the connected chest (defaults to on top of the MRS) and places the blocks within the ritual, which is a radius of 2 on the same level as the MRS. This can be useful if you are trying to lay out saplings for a tree farm or if there are other blocks that must be placed. The ritual takes 50LP per successful operation.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.ritual.timberman.info=Got wood? This ritual has you covered. The Crash of the Timberman tethers a spectral entity using the LP of the owner to harvest the leaves and logs of all trees within its range and places the results inside of the connected chest. It will try to find all "trees" in a 10 block horizontal radius and up to 30 blocks above the MRS (by default) and use 10LP per felled block.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.ritual.meteor.info=For all intents and purposes, this is one of the most powerful rituals currently in the game. It costs one million LP to activate and can only be used once before needing to be reactivated. The ritual, once specific sacrifices are made, pulls a meteor from outer space and causes it to plummet towards the ground, causing a large explosion once it hits something solid. Because these meteors are not from the Overworld, they can hold a rich ore density never seen anywhere else.\n\tSacrifices can include: an iron block, a gold block, a diamond. This is configurable by the mudpack or user.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.ritual.downgrade.info=In order to gain more power, sometimes you have to sacrifice something in return. The Penance of the Leadened Soul does just that - by sacrificing a few items to an unseen entity, you may reduce the effectiveness of some aspect of your Living Armour and get an increase in the number of upgrade points as compensation. When you construct the ritual you have to place an item frame on the top-most Blank ritual stone facing towards the Master Ritual stone, and some sort of inventory (see: chest) on top of the Dusk ritual stone. To acquire a Living Armour Downgrade, you then have to place the key item in the item frame and the consumables in the chest. Once the ritual is activated, you can sneak on top of the Master Ritual Stone at any time and acquire the downgrade.\n\tIn the case of the Quenched Living Armour Downgrade, its key item is a water bottle (placed in the item frame) and the recipe is Dragon's Breath (placed in the chest). The key item is never consumed, but the recipe is.\n\tIn order to view the recipe for the downgrades you can look them up in JEI - check the usage of the Master Ritual Stone and you will see the recipes for the Penance ritual. Also you can just check the recipe for the max level downgrade in JEI and then check the usage of the key item - the key item is always the same for the specific downgrade.

# Architect Entry Texts
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.intro.info=Hello, everyone. My name is Tiberius. You can probably tell by this entry that the book is not exactly complete, and you would be right. Because of the 1.7.10 -> 1.8.9 and 1.9.4 (and above) updates, a lot of stuff has changed in the mod. As such, the books have had to be rewritten. Because the ultimate plan for these documents is to have each book in the form of a research journal / actual book, these documents will take a while to flesh out. As such, I am going to be updating this book periodically in order to fill in the necessary gaps. It will start as flavourless garbage to start with (Yeah... not the most appetizing of illustrations to go with for documents, but whatever!), but slowly it will be morphed into a story about a bunch of blood magi on a journey through discovery.\n\tBut enough about that, I need to get into character. *Cough cough*\n\tMy name is Tiberius, and I am a Blood Mage, and also otherwise known as The Architect. This book contains all of my research regarding the ethereal phenomenon called the "Soul Network," as well as the physical properties of some of the most central devices that any Blood Mage in training should be accustomed to. From the art of laying out the structure of a powerful Blood Altar, to the intricacies of sacrificing life force to increase a mage's power, and further to the powers gained through arcane glyphs and sigils, I have discovered, revised, and created new ways into train one's self to new heights.\n\tSo enter, Mage, for a new realm awaits you!\n\t...Yeah, Magus says that I can get a little grandiose, but what can you do?
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.bloodaltar.info.1=The Blood Altar is one of the most central devices in the mod. There are two main uses for the altar: either for crafting certain items essential for progressing through the mod, or for filling up one's Blood Orb. Both of these actions require the player to fill up the basin with Life Essence, which can be extracted from two different sources: monsters and peaceful creatures, and the player's own health.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.bloodaltar.info.2=To add your own Life Essence into the basin, you need to craft yourself a Sacrificial Knife and right click it while next to the altar. This will take a heart of health and add a total of 200LP to the unupgraded altar. "LP" is Life Points, which is a measure of how much life force is used in a task - no, it is not like YuGi-Oh. The Blood Altar has a capacity of 10,000LP. If you then right-click on the altar, you can place an item into the basin, and if it is a valid item the altar will start the crafting process.\n\tThe altar crafts an item by consuming the LP in the basin if the altar is a high enough tier. If there is enough LP, the altar will drain a bit of LP from the basin each tick and increase the progress of the crafting, emitting red particles. If there is no longer any LP in the basin, the altar will emit gray particles and the crafting will start to lose progress, which is not good at all! Finally, if the altar is filling up a Blood Orb, the altar will emit purple particles to indicate it is syphoning LP from the basin.\n\tThere are actually a total of three tanks in the Blood Altar: the main tank, which has a default capacity of 10 kLP as previously indicated, as well as an input tank and an output tank which both have 10%% of the total capacity of the main tank. Every 20 ticks by default, the LP in the input tank will transfer to the main tank at 20LP/s, and the LP in the main tank will transfer to the output tank at 20LP/s. As the names suggest, the input tank accepts the LP that is pumped into the altar acting as a buffer to limit the speed of transferring from outside sources, and the output tank can be pulled from using pipes out of the altar.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.ash.info=Although not strictly part of the overall theme of this book, Arcane Ash is necessary in order to progress through the mod and get some of the more powerful devices available. This ash is crafted using the Hellfire Forge and Demon Will, so if you are new to this concept please consult the "Demon Kin." In essence, this is a way to craft items out of two separate items: a reagent of some sort to act as a catalyst, and a secondary item. \n\tThe ash has a total of twenty uses before you need to craft another. When you right click on the ground (or a wall, though it will only render one direction), you will inscribe a simple circle out of ash. If you click on the ash again with an item, it will be "placed inside of the ash" - assuming that this item is a valid catalyst, the circle will change shape to represent that it is ready for the next item. If it doesn't change shape, then you did something wrong.\n\tOnce it has changed shape, you can then place in the secondary item. If this item matches with the first item, the circle will start rotating and performing different actions depending on the recipe it is working on. After a while, if properly executed, an item will pop out.\n\tAll of the recipes for the Arcane Ash crafting (I call it Alchemy Array Crafting) can be found in JEI by checking the uses for Arcane Ash - the first item shown is the catalyst, and the second item is the secondary item.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.divination.info=The Divination Sigil is one of the most useful tools in the mod, able to tell you many values that will make your life easier. This sigil is crafted using a piece of redstone and a blank slate (crafted in the Blood Altar) using an alchemy array.\n\tWhen you right click a Blood Altar with the sigil, you can see the current tier, amount of LP inside of the main basin, as well as the max capacity of the Blood Altar. Spam-clicking the altar with the sigil will overwrite the previous text from the sigil, meaning that there will not be any spam in your chat.\n\tIf you right click in the air with the sigil, the sigil will tell you the current amount of LP that is in your Soul Network. Although this is rather mundane to start with, this function alone will make it very likely that you will want to keep this sigil on you at all times. 
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.soulnetwork.info=The Soul Network (commonly abbreviated as SN) is the term for the connections between the player and all of the items and structures that they have linked their soul to. When a blood mage becomes more powerful, the strength of their soul increases and thickens these bonds. These connections are ethereal strands of the soul, and only the most powerful of Blood Magi are able to see these in their physical form. To date, no mage has attained this ability...\n\tIn-game, the Soul Network is tied directly to the player. The data is stored inside of the world, and every player has only a single network - the LP placed into the network is not stored in any item, but is instead placed and drawn from a single pool. \n\tTo bind things to your network, the most common way is to simply right click an item that uses a network to power itself. Once bound, the item will indicate that it is owned by you and it can never be unbound (with current technology). If this item is used and it has an LP cost attributed to it, it will take the LP from the owner's network. If there is not enough LP in this network, it will take the missing LP directly from the user's health (not the owner's). Be careful when using items when you have a low amount of LP - it could end up being deadly.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.weakorb.info.1=What good is any mage without a power source? A Blood Orb is a device that consumes physical LP and transfers it into the owner's Soul Network. Although not a battery itself, it does act as a conduit in order to fill up the power reserves of the blood mage. 
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.weakorb.info.2=The Weak Blood Orb is the first such orb that you can make. By infusing a diamond inside of a Blood Altar with 2 kLP, you can create this orb. When bound and placed inside of an altar with some LP in it, the orb will syphon from the basin and transfer that LP directly into the network. Each orb has a maximum capacity that can only be extended by advanced runes on the altar. For the Weak Blood Orb, this maximum capacity is 5 kLP.\n\tBlood Orbs can also be filled directly from the player by simply right-clicking with them - this will transfer a heart of health into the orb and give you 200LP. This cannot increase past the orb's maximum capacity.\n\tA Blood Orb can only be filled by its tier of altar or higher; this means that if you have a T3 orb, it has to be filled in an altar that is greater than T3. A simple T1 altar would not do in this situation.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.incense.info.1=One will quickly find that the speed of LP generation can become increasingly burdensome. Sure, by adding special runes to the Blood Altar you are able to increase the yield of self-sacrificing, but this can be a slow process all the same. If only there was a way to further increase how much LP you can get from yourself?\n\tEnter the Incense Altar. The Incense Altar acts as a central point for a tranquil area, calming the soul itself with the gentle wafts that emanate from the basin. Where this scent comes from you aren't entirely sure, but what could possibly go wrong?\n\tThe goal of this block is to create an area of tranquility to increase how much LP you get from a heart of health. When you are near the block (about five blocks) fire particles will be emitted to show that it is working - when you are affected by this tranquility, your Sacrificial Dagger will transform to indicate that you have an increased yield at the Blood Altar. This process takes about 5 seconds, and you will know you are finished when the fire particles stop appearing. At this point, if you use your Sacrificial Dagger at the Blood Altar you will sacrifice 90%% of your maximum health all at once and pump LP into the altar proportional to the amount of health sacrificed multiplied by a bonus based on how tranquil the surrounding area is: this bonus is +20%% by default.\n\tAs a side note, the Divination Sigil can be used on the Incense Altar to determine the amount of Tranquility as well as how much of a bonus the current altar gives.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.incense.info.2=Of course just an additional 20%% is all well and good, but it can be further expanded by expanding the range of influence of the Incense Altar. If you place a row of three Wooden Path blocks two blocks away from the incense altar in each of the cardinal directions (making sure that all path blocks are on the same y-level, up to five blocks up or down from the incense altar) you can define an area. Any block placed within this area (a block that is the same distance horizontally away from the Incense Altar as the path blocks are horizontally, and on the same level or up to two blocks higher vertically from the path blocks) can add to the Tranquility of the Incense Altar. Another row of path blocks can be added past this initial row following the same rule: the new row must all be on the same y-level as each other, and the entire row has to be within 5 blocks vertically from the previous row of path blocks. This means that layouts such as pyramids, inverted pyramids, or more advanced staircase structures are possible.\n\tAll path blocks have a maximum distance that they can be from the Incense Altar in order to take effect. The Wooden Path blocks are able to work up to a total of three rows from the Incense Altar. Stone paths work up to five, worn stone paths seven and obsidian paths to nine. So at a certain point you have to use better path blocks to extend your tranquility area, however you can use higher tiered path blocks in place of lower tiered path blocks, just not the other way around.\n\tBack to Tranquility. Only certain blocks are able to affect the Tranquility of an area, and there are different types of Tranquility blocks. If you place a crop such as potatoes in the area, you add a bit of Tranquility (using the Crops category). However, if you add another crop like potatoes again or even carrots, you will get less tranquility. Adding something from a different Tranquility category, you get the full effect. But adding more stuff using the same category has diminishing returns. Therefore in order to get the most Tranquility out of a certain area, it is most optimal to mix and match using as many different types of Tranquility as possible.\n\tSome things that add Tranquility are: Crops, logs, leaves, lava, netherrack, farmland, water, Life Essence, and other assorted things.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.bloodrune.info.1=As you go through the mod you'll slowly learn that the humble blood altar before you is not powerful enough for you to fulfil your true ambitions. By placing special blocks known as Blood Runes around the altar you are able to expand the altar's strength significantly, unlocking higher tiers of recipes as well as allowing you to augment the abilities of the altar itself.\n\tTo upgrade the altar to its second tier, you need to place 8 blood runes around the altar and one level lower. If you are confused about the precise configuration, the item "Inspectoris Scandalum" can tell you the precise placement for the blocks required for the next tier.\n\tAlthough a blank rune is fine for simply getting your altar upgrade and running to a higher tier, it is advantageous to use upgrade runes for your altar. Each of the runes in a blood altar may be swapped out for any upgrade rune (the only exception to this is that at Tier 2 you cannot use the corner runes as upgrade runes - T3 onwards you can use these). There are runes that affect the speed of crafting, the capacity of the altar, as well as the efficiency of sacrificing at the altar. These runes can be found in their respective entries.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.inspectoris.info.1=Literally "Block Reader" in Latin, this item's purpose is to give you more information about the more complex blocks in the mod when the blocks are in the world. Currently the only implementation for this item is the Blood Altar, and by simply shift-right clicking on a Blood Altar in the world it will tell you what blocks are required in the world for the next altar tier.\n\tIf this method doesn't suit you, you may shift-right click the item in the air to cycle through the tiers. If you then shift-right click on the altar, the altar will display ghost blocks in the world, showing exactly where the blood runes and the pillars are required in order to achieve that tier.  If you set the displayed tier to 1, it will remove the hologram.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.runeSpeed.info.1=The speed rune applies a pressure to the altar's basin, forcing the transmutation process so that crafting is a lot quicker. Each speed rune increases the consumption of the altar by +20%% per rune, effectively increasing the speed of the altar. This also affects the speed at which the blood orbs are filled by the altar at the same rate per rune.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.water.info.1=The Water Sigil, as the name suggests, is able to gather moisture from the air to create a source of water at the point of contact on the ground. What is more, by clicking on a machine that accepts a fluid, you can insert up to 1000mB of water into the machine for the same cost as if you put it on the ground. For all intents and purposes, it acts as an infinite bucket of water - it won't work if you place it inside of a machine, however. 50LP per use.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.lava.info.1=The Yang to the Water Sigil's Yin, this sigil heats up the rock in the local area and gathers it in one place, forming a source of lava where the sigil makes contact. A similar process occurs when you interact on a fluid-accepting machine, generating up to 1000mB of lava inside of the machine for the same cost. For some reason your hand is not burnt when you use it, however it doesn't mean that it is a wise choice to take a bath in it! 1000LP per use.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.lavaCrystal.info.1=The lava crystal is a stone that has a piece of lava encased in the center of it that does not lose its heat. When placed as a fuel source inside of a furnace, it will "burn" for an amount that is enough to cook a single item in a standard furnace at the cost of 50LP from the owner's network. If the network does not have enough power in it (or if there is no owner) the crystal will simply not burn and will inflict nausea on the owner due to the strain.\n\tThis crystal will work for any solid fuel burning machine that accepts any fuel.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.apprenticeorb.info.1=While out using the various devices, you will quickly realise that your 5kLP maximum capacity in your Soul Network will quickly run out. This is where you will start looking for a more powerful orb for your network.\n\tThe Apprentice Blood Orb requires a Tier 2 altar, and has a maximum capacity of 25kLP. It also allows you to create more powerful items and runes.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.dagger.info.1=After a while of strengthening yourself through the use of self-sacrifice, you may be keen to attempt to try sacrificing the blood of mobs. The Dagger of Sacrifice, when used on a non-boss, non-player entity next to a Blood Altar, will kill the entity in one hit and pump all of the blood into the altar, converting it into life essence depending on the quality of the mob. Normally, hostile mobs will tend to give much more LP than peaceful mobs.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.runeSacrifice.info.1=The Rune of Sacrifice, as the name may imply, increases the yield of all activities that sacrifice the health of mobs in return for LP. Each rune provides a +10%% increase in yield, additively. 
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.runeSelfSacrifice.info.1=Similar to the Rune of Sacrifice, the Rune of Self Sacrifice increases the yield of LP provided from the player. Each rune provides a +10%% increase in yield, additively.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.holding.info.1=As you will start to realize, there are a lot of useful sigils that are available - some toggleable, others active use. Because of this your inventory will quickly become clogged up. This need is filled by the Sigil of Holding.\n\tThis sigil can hold up to five other sigils (no, it cannot hold other Sigils of Holding) in its internal inventory. By pressing the "Holding" key, default 'H', you can open up the sigil's GUI to rearrange the sigils that are held. If you shift and use the scroll-wheel while it is equipped, you will cycle through the contained sigils. Once you land on the sigil that you want to use, you can use the sigil as if it was the one selected! \n\tNaturally, you can have multiple Sigils of Holding, each with their own inventory. To help determine which one is which at a glance, you can dye the sigil using the Alchemy Table. To do this, either place the Sigil of Holding in the Alchemy Table with a dye, or the sigil with a name tag with the colour that you want in 0xZZZZZZ format for the name.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.air.info.1=The Air Sigil uses a rudimentary form of fission to generate a steady stream of air behind the user by the traces of water vapour in the air, propelling them forward. In essence, by using this sigil you can be launched forward a considerable distance. It should be noted that the sigil will only cancel the user's fall distance when used, so if you want to stick the landing you have to use it close to the ground!
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.void.info.1=As the name suggests, the Void Sigil will create a vacuum at the point of contact which will suck up the liquid source that it is used on, completely destroying the source. This is probably best used in conjunction with the Water Sigil or the Lava Sigil.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.greenGrove.info.1=By using your blood as a simple growth catalyst of sorts, the Sigil of the Green Grove will increase the growth speed of any plants in a nearby area while activated. To activate the sigil, shift-right click it to toggle between activated and deactivated (easily seen by the tooltip or by the glowing symbols on the sigil). Keep in mind that every few seconds the sigil will syphon a bit of LP from the user to fuel the accelerated growth.\n\tIf used directly on a plant, the sigil will apply a bone-meal effect. This can be used to grow tall grass or other crops, just the same as bone-meal.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.fastMiner.info.1=As any good Blood Mage should be aware of, blood has a high amount of iron within it. If skilled enough, one can manipulate blood while it is still within the body - it should be noted, however, that only the most advanced Blood Mages can twist the blood of those that are unwilling.\n\tOne of the principle uses is to accelerate the functions of one's own body. By magnetising the iron in the user's blood, the Sigil of the Fast Miner increases the speed of mining dramatically, applying Haste II while activated. This magnetism is too weak to affect things outside of one's own body, however it is sufficient enough to mine obsidian and a considerable speed.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.seer.info.1=When tinkering around with the Blood Altar, you can sometimes get lost in the hidden intricacies of its operation that the Divination Sigil seems to be unable to divine. This is where the Seer's Sigil comes into play. Essentially an upgrade to the Divination Sigil, this sigil provides additional information about different stats of the altar. These range from the speed of the altar, the current LP, as well as the current progress of the crafted item. It also gives info about the player's soul network.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.magicianOrb.info.1=Another tier, another Blood Orb. This time, in order to progress further in the mod you will have to craft yourself the Magician Blood Orb. In the default recipe you can see that it takes 25kLP in order to craft, however the maximum capacity of the Blood Altar is 10kLP. This means that for a successful craft to occur you will need to add LP into the Altar while it is in the process of crafting the orb. Be prepared, since it can be a difficult task if you do not have everything you need!
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.capacity.info.1=You are not exactly sure how it works the way it does, but the Rune of Capacity increases the capacity of the Blood Altar by 2kLP additively. Perhaps there is some sort of resonance effect that decreases the volume of the LP, therefore allowing you to pack more into the static basin? It does give you an idea on how to improve it further, though...\n\tIt should be reiterated that the size of the input and output buffers are 10%% of the maximum capacity of the main tank, so these runes will increase the buffer capacities as well.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.displacement.info.1=By default, the transfer of LP between the buffer and main tanks is limited to 20LP/s. For systems that want to remove and re-add LP to the altar this speed is a sluggish crawl. That is where this rune comes into play.\n\tThe Displacement Rune increases the amount of LP transferred per operation. Each rune multiplies the transfer rate by 1.2x, stacking multiplicatively. So one rune would be 24LP per operation, two runes would be 28.8LP per operation, and three runes 34.56LP. If you have 20 runes on an altar, this jumps all the way up to 767LP per operation - that would clear a full altar in only 13 seconds. 
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.affinity.info.1=At first glance, the Sigil of Elemental Affinity simply grants immunity to fire, drowning, and damage from heights while activated. Its operation is a lot more nuanced, however. This sigil creates a thin barrier of air around the user by using the sweat (and when required, blood) from the user, keeping the body away from the harsh elements. \n\tThis air barrier acts as a buffer between the skin and the fire or lava, circulating when required to prevent overheating. It also fills the lungs while under water to equalize the pressure of the body and the surrounding water. Finally, when falling from a large height, the air will shift to below the person's feet, acting as a cushion to dampen the fall. 
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.lamp.info.1=There are quite a few "impurities" within the body and a person's blood. By harvesting some noble gases and encasing them with a source of heat, you can generate a ball of light that can be flung a large distance, sticking to the surface that it impacts with.\n\tThe Sigil of the Blood Lamp has two uses: you can either directly click a block and place a light source or fire a projectile that will generate a source of light at the point of contact. These light sources can be broken just like torches in one hit.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.magnetism.info.1=This sigil magnetizes the iron in the blood stream of the user to attract small objects towards the sigil, allowing a quick and painless pickup. In essence this acts as an item magnet, but instead of actually "vacuuming" up items towards the player, it causes the player to pick up the item from a distance, so items don't need to fly around the place. Thankfully the magnetism is tuned so that it does not attract living objects, so you won't find creepers suddenly wanting to hug you at Mach 3. 

guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.peritia.info.1=In the world, certain actions impress experiences on a person: slaying monsters, mining elements, and smelting ingots or food can give experience that is accumulated over a period of time. Through some arcane mechanisms, some structures and devices actually drains these experiences from you in order to fuel their own processes. It can therefore be useful to store these experiences in some medium.\n\tAlthough some containers store experience as a physical substance, the Tome of Peritia allows the person to transcribe their experiences into the book - by writing in the tome, the pages are imbued with your thoughts and past actions, storing them away for later use. If you then want to acquire these experiences back, you can hold your hand to the page and syphon them back; this will remove the writing from the page and transmit those actions back to your memory.\n\tNow for the actual usage; by shift-right clicking the tome in your hand, you can store a level of experience into the book (or down to the level if you have a partial level). Right clicking with the tome will grant you up to the next level if there is enough experience stored in the book.

guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.livingArmour.info.1=Any person in Minecraft, especially with the newer incarnations of the world, will know that a good set of armour means difference between life and death. Usually when you pick a set of armour you choose a static set of benefits - does this armour offer more protection? Do I get flight when I wear this? Can I jump really high, or move really fast? These are all valid options on a set of armour, but you can never get a set that is tailored exactly to your needs. At least that is what they thought.\n\tA set of Living Armour is an engineered lifeform that is integrated with a simple set of iron armour. When worn, it enters a symbiotic relationship with the user - when you move, it moves. When you attack, it attacks. When you eat, it senses this and compensates. And just like a normal human body, it will start to grow and strengthen depending on what you do, being trained by your actions. \n\tLet's give an example. If you equip a new set of armour on and run around a lot, you will notice that you will receive an upgrade on the chest plate called "Quick Feet" - this upgrade provides an incremental increase to your speed at level 1, while subsequent levels provide a larger boost. You will also notice that the "Upgrade Points" now read "3/100" - each upgrade requires a number of upgrade points to be applied, and the chest plate has a maximum number of points that it can hold. If an upgrade that you can get is not obtainable with the number of free upgrade points you have it cannot be gained. \n\tKeep in mind that the Living Armour will only be trained when you have a full set of armour on, and the armour's effects will only take effect when a full set of armour is used.\n\tThe maximum number of upgrade points can be modified by a few different means. One of them is to create alchemical concoctions that will strengthen the bonds between the user and the Living Armour, vastly increasing the number of points you can have on a given set of equipment. One such example is the "Draft of Angelus," which increases the maximum number of points to 200. Information about these brews, as well as how to create them, can be found in "The Alchemist". 
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.upgradeTome.info.1=Sometimes you may not be happy with the upgrades that you have gotten on your Living Armour. By using the ritual "Sound of the Cleansing Soul" (more information can be found in "The Ritual Master"), you can remove all of the upgrades from the armour and receive them in the form of "Upgrade Tomes". If you right-click these while wearing a full set of Living Armour (and while you have space for the upgrade) you can add the upgrade to your armour. \n\tThese tomes may also be combined in an anvil - if you combine two of the exact same upgrade tomes (same upgrade, same level) together in an anvil, you can get a single tome that is one level higher. So if you combine Quick Feet II with another Quick Feet II, you will get Quick Feet III. This can then be applied to the armour in the same way.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.teleposer.info.1=The Teleposer is a device that teleports not just entities but blocks as well. In order to set up a Teleposer, you need at least two Teleposers and one Teleposition focus. One of the Teleposers acts as the Destination, and the other acts as the Beginning.\n\tTo set this up, you need to first bind the focus to you by right clicking it. You then right click the focus onto the Destination Teleposer to save its location (and dimension) and then insert the focus into the Beginning Teleposer by right clicking the Teleposer without a focus in your hand and placing the focus inside of the GUI.\n\tPowering the Beginning Teleposer (the one with the focus) with a strong redstone signal will cause the Teleposers to swap the entities and blocks (including any content in the tiles such as chest inventories) between the Teleposers, assuming that there is a Teleposer at the Destination. \n\tYou can either have one Teleposer have a focus, have both of the Teleposers have foci that are linked to each other, or you can have one Teleposer linked to another Teleposer that is not linked to it, so depending on how you set them up you can have very intricate systems.\n\tKeep in mind that currently the Teleposer will only swap the blocks and entities that are right above the block, and the size depends on the focus - the T1 focus only swaps the block on top of the Teleposer, the T2 focus swaps a 3x3x3 area above the Teleposer, etc.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.boundBlade.info.1=The Bound Blade is an artifact from the past, a blade that is created by binding an entity to a sword in the same process that creates the Living Armour. It should be noted that this, as well as the Bound Tools, will change in later versions of the mod.\n\tThe sword has an active and inactive mode, which can be toggled by shift-right clicking. The sword does not deal any damage at all when inactive, but while active there will be a small LP drain over time. Likewise, when you damage a mob you will drain LP from your network. Sure, you have a lot of damage, but it may kill you!\n\tWhen a monster is killed, the monster has a chance to drop a Weak Blood Shard. These shards are used in order to upgrade your Blood Altar to a T4 altar.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.boundTool.info.1=Similar to the Bound Blade, these Bound Tools (pickaxe, axe, and shovel) will eventually be modified to fit better in the mod. Like the Blade, the tools have an active and inactive mode that can be toggled between by shift-right clicking them. \n\tSomething that these tools have is something called "Beast Mode". If you hold right click, you can charge up the tool and unleash a powerful cleave that will instantly break the blocks that can be broken by the given tool - when fully charged, this is an 11x11x11 cube above you at a cost of 10kLP. Be careful with this powerful tool, since it may be your last!
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.weakShard.info.1=Everything that has life can have the ethereal connections that is known as the Soul Network. As seen in your experiences, non-living things can also have a Soul Network attached to them, such as sigils and rituals; however, these connections are the strongest in creatures and, naturally, humans. \n\tWhen you attack a monster with a Bound Blade, their Soul Network temporarily hardens and a piece of it will remain after death. This piece takes the form of a Weak Blood Shard, so named after the fact its reddish hue matches the colour of the Weak Blood Orb. At this point, it is not clear if there are stronger forms of blood shards, but you can tell that this would be very helpful in increasing the power of your own Soul Network
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.masterOrb.info.1=One of the uses for this increased affinity for the Soul Network is to use the Weak Blood Shard in a new blood orb: the Master Blood Orb. This orb has a maximum capacity of 1 million LP, and thus allows the wielder of the orb to access more powerful items and rituals. Perhaps meteors are not out of your reach...
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.runeOrb.info.1=Initially, this rune can be seen as somewhat useless. By thickening the ties between the blood orb in the altar and the Soul Network, the Rune of the Orb increases the maximum capacity of a blood orb filled by a Blood Altar by +2%% per rune, additively. For something like the Weak Blood Orb, this is just +100LP capacity, however for the Master Blood Orb this is a remarkable +20kLP capacity per rune. If you have a high tier blood orb and a few extra runes to spare on your altar, this may be something to round out your network.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.suppression.info.1=The Sigil of Suppression uses the technology that is used in a Teleposer in order to temporarily displace fluids that are near it when active. This is done by teleposing the liquids in a sphere around the user to a hidden pocket dimension, replacing the liquid with air. Unfortunately, because you are overcharging the field used by the Teleposer, the teleposition is temporary - if the user walks away from the area that the liquid was teleposed away from or deactivates the sigil, the liquids will pop back where they were before as if nothing has happened, assuming that there are no newly-placed blocks there. This allows for fancy transportation when on foot, walking under the water instead of swimming through it or even parting the red seas of the Nether.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.haste.info.1=Sugar and caffeine are interesting chemicals that the human body can process. One acts as a reservoir of energy that is quickly burned, whereas the other increases your wakefulness and allows you to access energy in other means. By mimicking these chemical processes to unleash more chemical energy, the Sigil of Haste allows the user to increase their movement abilities. \n\tWhile activated, the user can run a lot faster and is able to jump significantly higher. What is more, the sigil also offers "Step Assist," which allows the user to step up one block high ridges without needing to jump. It's like auto-jump, but less sucky.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.severance.info.1=Teleportation is one of those odd powers that people can't fully explain. In most instances, teleportation can be described as a temporary warp in space-time, linking two places in space together so that the object in question can simply "step" through to the other side. The Sigil of Ender Severance attempts to stop this warping that teleportation requires, preventing creatures from teleporting when they are around the user. This does not stop some of the larger means of teleportation such as portals, but it will prevent Endermen from using their powers to warp around the user. 
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.teleposition.info.1=The Teleposition Sigil has a contained Teleposer and focus in its structure. If you right click a Teleposer with this sigil, you can bind the coordinates and dimension to the sigil. Now, whenever you right click the sigil it will telepose you directly to the Teleposer (if it is there). Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like you are able to do a return trip... 
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.compression.info.1=A miner will quickly find that during a long expedition their inventory will become filled with redstone dust, lapis, and several other materials. Most of these have recipes that will compress them down to storage blocks such as redstone blocks and blocks of diamonds, however they normally require a crafting table in order to combine them. \n\tThis sigil creases a miniature field of compression in the inventory of the user when activated, compressing items down to the lowest number of slots needed for the inventory. What this means is that if you have 63 redstone dust it will not do anything. However, if you have 64 dust it will compress 9 of them into a block of redstone. While this is technically not the ideal situation if you have exactly a stack of redstone dust, it will guarantee that you aren't left in the dust due to full pockets. If other mods are present this will work for other crafting recipes as well.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.bridge.info.1=When activated and while the user is on solid ground, the Sigil of the Phantom Bridge solidifies the air beneath the user so that they may walk on it, essentially creating a Phantom Bridge. When you are shifting in the air, the bridge will instead form directly underneath you, allowing you to catch yourself in the air if you were falling. Although some calibration is needed in order to make it more effective for vertical travel as well as horizontal travel when moving quickly (due to lag messing up the creation of the bridge), it is a fancy way to effectively fly to different areas.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.mimic.info.1=Mimics are arcane constructs that are designed to mimic whatever they are set to. When the mimic comes into contact with some form of block, its molecules shift their orientation in order to take on the shape, look, and feel of the block. Not all of the properties are copied, however: for instance, a normal mimic block when coming into contact with glowstone will not emit any form of light. \n\tWith normal use, there are two ways to use a mimic block. The first is my placing the mimic block down and then right-clicking the mimic with the block that you want it to copy. This will place the block inside of the mimic and have the mimic take on the -default- shape of the block. So if a mimic is clicked with a stair, the mimic will always orient themselves in the same way.\n\tThe second method is to hold the mimic block in your hand and shift-click the block you want to replace. This will replace the block with the mimic and the mimic will have the exact same orientation that the replaced block had. This can be seen with stairs and chests, as well as other orientation-dependent blocks such as logs.\n\tThere are a few different variants of the normal mimics. The Opaque Mimic is the default mimic, able to take on the form and general properties of blocks - light cannot travel through these, however, so care should be taken with glass. The Ethereal Opaque Mimic can be walked through without any trouble because it has no hitbox, which is perfect for hidden doorways. Clear Mimic blocks work the same as their opaque variants, however they allow light through them even if it appears completely solid. Finally, the Lighted Mimic block is opaque and solid, but no matter what is placed inside of it, it will emit a strong light. No more dark areas in your base without torch spam!\n\tThere is one special variant of the mimic that you have to be warry of: the Sentient Mimic. If a player comes too close to one of these in the world, it will get up from where it is and attack you with a high degree of ferocity. These can be found in a variety of areas, but they are especially fond of dungeons. If one is mimicking a chest, however, be careful: they bite.\n\t***Creative Usage Only***\n\tThere are a few interesting features you can add to any mimic block when you are in creative mode. If you right click on a set mimic with a potion or potion flask, you can set the mimic to spawn potions around it if a player is nearby. If it is a regular mimic and you click on the east or west side, you can increase or decrease the radius that the potion will spawn in. If you click on the north or south side, you can increase or decrease the radius that the mimic will check for players around it before spawning the potions. Finally, clicking on the top or bottom of the block will increase or decrease the potion spawning interval, which is the number of ticks between dropped potions.\n\tIf the mimic is a sentient mimic, you can click the mimic anywhere to increase or decrease the detection radius for players - if a player is within this area and they can see the block, the mimic will spawn and jump at the player. \n\tAnother thing is that if the block is placed on the mimic while the placer is in creative, the block that is being mimicked will NOT drop when the mimic is destroyed.\n\tFinally, if the mimic is placed on any inventory or chest, the sentient mimic will place the chest on the ground with its contents once defeated - the regular mimic will instead just spew the contents everywhere when broken.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.downgrade.info=Please see the entry "Penance of the Leadened Soul" in "The Ritual Master" for a detailed explanation about what these are as well as how to obtain them.

guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.augmentedCapacity.info=The Rune of Augmented Capacity functions similar to the Rune of Capacity in the sense that it increases the capacity of the Blood Altar. However, multiple runes on the same altar will begin to resonate with each other, increasing the capacity exponentially the more there are. One rune by itself will apply a +10%% increase to the capacity of the altar, however this functions multiplicatively with other Runes of Augmented Capacity: if there are two runes, it is a +21%% increase, three runes is +33.1%% increase, etc.\n\tUnfortunately, this multiplicative effect does not stack with the Rune of Capacity, meaning you will still only get the +2kLP bonus per rune.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.charging.info=The Charging Rune is one of those beauties that will completely change the operation of the Blood Altar to something that can be seen as more useful for one-stop crafting. By syphoning off the LP from the Blood Altar slowly, the Charging rune begins storing "Charge," an internal value of the Blood Altar that can be seen using the Sigil of Sight. If the Blood Altar has enough Charge when it gets something to craft, it will use the required Charge up immediately and craft the item instantaneously. If there is not enough Charge, the Charge is all used to increase the progress of the item at a 1:1 Charge:LP ratio. \n\tThe maximum amount of Charge that can be stored in the Blood Altar is a function of the number of Charging Runes that it has multiplied by the current capacity of the altar (the capacity of the altar only comes into effect if it is greater than 20k). The rate that it charges is also related directly to the speed of the altar times the number of Charging Runes it has, and it will convert LP into Charge once every 20 ticks (one second). So if you were to design a Blood Altar with this rune, careful consideration will have to be made for all of the synergistic relationships that it has.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.architect.acceleration.info=Unlike most runes, the Rune of Acceleration works best only when paired with other runes, and its effects only increase to a limited amount. What this rune does is it increases the number of processing ticks that can occur in a given period of time, specifically when it comes to the Displacement Rune and Charging Rune. For each rune added, the number of ticks before the next processing tick decreases by one. For instance, by default the Displacement Rune displaces liquids at a rate of one operation per 20 ticks - with 10 Runes of Acceleration, this would occur at a rate of one operation per 10 ticks.\n\tObviously the maximum number of Acceleration Runes that presently matter is 19 - if you have this many, the Displacement Rune and Charging Rune will both activate their effects each tick. Noice!

# Demon Kin Entry Texts
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.intro.info=My name is Bella Highborn, and I am known as the Demon Kin. Several months ago my village was attacked by a wave of demons, killing all other people while destroying every single building. I don't remember much from the attack, other than the screams of pain as each and every person I knew left this world for a happier one. Thankfully the demons did not hear me as I cowered underneath the fruit baskets in the basement of the church of Intactilis, trying desperately to keep my screams from joining the chorus of other voices. \nThere was one horrible moment when I accidentally knocked down the incense altar of the church and a demon came bounding into the sanctuary, unperturbed by what we assumed was a sacred place. It was a huge four-legged monster, with curved tusks hanging past a jutting mouth, saliva dripping onto serrated swords taking the place of his claws. It took a look around the room and I swear it locked eyes with me for a solid second, but then it just simply left as if it neither heard nor saw anything. Everything afterwards was a blur. \nIt was a full day before anyone came to see what happened. A trading caravan saw the smoke in the distance and decided to take the long way around past the demons. Many of the traders didn't even want to look at me, fearing that because I alone managed to survive unscathed it was a bad omen. But two brothers decided to take pity on me and try to convince the rest of the caravan to consider having me ride along. It took me selling the priestess's wand and locket, but I managed to buy safe passage to a village far enough away from the demons' path of destruction. 
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.snare.info.1=Magus was telling me one day that every living being has a soul: humans, chicken, sheep, and even creepers have this life force that would give the body the will to live. It seems that Magus has done a lot of experiments in his time, and has even heard of a powerful mage that could take these souls and transfuse them into empty vessels such as zombies. But that made me wonder: if zombies and skeletons did not have souls, how is it that they had a will to live? What animated them so that they would try to hunt down any living creature and try to kill them? \n\tIt all came back to will, each and every single time. Anything "living" had to have a will in order to survive, but it didn't mean that it had to be their own. When I brought this up to Magus he pondered a little, and then brought out a blackboard and chalk (from where, who knows) and started to sketch some notes about other forms of magic. "In Thaumaturgy," he said while sketching out the form of a straw man, "golems are animated beings that are tasked to perform many mundane operations. They live, breathe, and can even die if they fall out of favour with their masters. In the current iteration of Thaumaturgy, and yes there have been several versions of this art over the centuries, the magician would imbue their will into their inanimate creation and bring them to life.\n\t"That, Bella, is how golems operate: by an imbuement of will."\n\tSo if a golem could live by another entity imbuing its will into an empty shell, maybe some other entity is imbuing its will into the bodies of the dead, bringing zombies and skeletons into existence. At this point I shivered, remembering briefly what happened in my old village. Only a demon could do something so cruel. But to test this hypothesis, I needed more proof.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.snare.info.2=With some direction from Magus, and Tiberius when he could lend a hand from his own work, I made myself a rudimentary snare out of some iron, string, and a bit of redstone. Tiberius, who studied Thaumaturgy in-depth as his cross-discipline magic of choice, said that the snare should be able to disrupt the will of an entity that is controlling an animated object. "I was messing around with this when playing around with golems," he said with a smile. We all knew how well that turned out. "Redstone seemed to disrupt the connection between my golems and my will for them to move. In theory, if something is controlling the zombies or skeletons, you should be able to cut off the will."\n\tHe said that all I needed to do was to throw it - if it worked, some white dust should stream off of the entity for a period of time. "So you have to kill it after this happens in order for anything to really happen. But the snare might only work 25%% of the time, so be slightly liberal with them!"\n\tAfter crafting sixteen of them, I went out with my sword during the night. It was quite tricky, actually: I had to track down several zombies, ducking and dodging their lumbering swipes while chucking a few snares at them. Once the white particles came off of them, I killed them swiftly and picked up what was left of their bodies. A small amount of a blue viscous fluid seemed to lay in the gritty dust, beckoning to me. I picked it up, and it seemed like there was some otherworldly "presence" coming from the fluid. Quickly stowing the samples away, I elected to look at them more deeply when I got back home. \n\tIt seemed that the size and shape of each "Demonic Will" varied, as if the quality of the will depended on the source. Using a completely arbitrary unit of measurement, the Will that I got from the snares seem to range from zero to five "Will Quality". I am not sure what I can use this substance for yet, but it is very intriguing none the less. I can't tell if this is the imprint of the will of some sort of demon, or just a random crystal found in their bodies. More research is needed.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.forge.info.1=I have spent several weeks researching the uses and properties of demonic will. There has been some success these past few days, however it has been infrequent. Tiberius asked me the other day if he could take a sample of demonic will for a few of his other experiments: he mentioned that it might be what he needed to construct a new blood altar to replace the beat-up basin that we were using in Magus's basement, since trying to replicate that old thing with just stone never seemed to create the right... receptacle for our blood magic. In other words, he thinks it may help.\n\tIt hasn't been a complete waste, however! I consulted several different alchemy textbooks discussing "Equivalent Exchange" and the many different ways to manipulate matter. I also talked to a couple of alchemists that were passing by, and they gave me a few tips on how to deconstruct matter and energy in order to study it more closely. (As a side note, I must say I loved the dark purple armour that one alchemist was wearing - just looking at it made me feel like I was being pulled by a dense object. Not talking about Tiberius, either!) From using those simple arrays with the little samples that I had, I managed to see that there were ways to actually tap into the power source inside of the demonic will. I just needed the right configuration.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.forge.info.2=Just today, I managed to get a structure that I believed would fuse together items using this raw will. Dubbed the "Hellfire Forge", the structure uses a simple alchemy array carved into the glass on the top of it to fuse up to four items together while injecting it with demonic will. The piece of demonic will is placed on the right-hand side and the four ingredients are placed around the circle. It appears that there are many different "recipes" available in this forge, but there are some gating effects on these. \n\tFor starters, there is a minimum amount of demonic will that has to be in the sample in order for the items to combine - if there isn't enough will in the structure, nothing seems to happen. Next, it seems that although there is a minimum amount of will needed, most of the recipes don't drain the entire sample of its will. Some recipes need a vast amount of demonic will in order to start the process, but only a little bit is used in the crafting, if any at all. Some recipes seem to be very easy to create in large quantities, but others... not so much.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.petty.info.1=I went out on one of my now-daily nighttime adventures in order to harvest some demonic will when I began to realize one of the major problems with the collection method: my bag kept on getting full from all of the samples! For some reason, perhaps because the ultimate source of the demonic will is different for each sample, the will would not compress into a more manageable form. At least the physical manifestation of the will. \n\tThus, I went to work with the hellfire forge that was nestled in my corner of the house, pushing aside some of Tiberius's least unpleasant experiments and getting some raw materials for my own study. One of these days I am going to make Tiberius his own forge, since I am tired of trying to get rid of all of the dust that coats my workplace from his "arcane experiments". I don't care that you are "trying to bridge the gap between the ethereal strands of the Soul Network and the physical construction of the slates", get your damned ash out of my stuff!
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.petty.info.2=Anyway, it did take a while in order to find materials that were most likely to resonate with the demonic will in order to store it in a better manner. Lapis seems to be the most readily available conductor of this energy, acting as a pathway for the will to be channeled. After adding some redstone to act as a shielding from electric fields in the air (adding two energies together seem to cause disastrous effects, at least that is what Magus said), gold as a dampening agent, and glass as a simple housing, I managed to create a very simple "Tartaric Gem". This means "a gem from the underworld, Tartarus."\n\tAfter further tests, I found out that this gem could hold up to a will quality of 64. (When I presented these findings to Magus, he remarked that it seemed like a nice, round number.) When I tried to pick up demonic will afterwards, it seemed to go directly into the gem unless full - after that, the will just seemed to... disappear. Convenient for my backpack, but otherwise a mystery. I also learned that if I hold the gem in my hand and focused (right clicked), about 10%% of the maximum capacity of the gem would flow into other gems I had on my person. I think this last feature is very helpful, especially if we were to find other, more powerful tartaric gems.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.sword.info.1=My snares got tangled again.\n\tIt doesn't seem to matter how much I try to improve the design of them, the rudimentary snare never seems to work perfectly. It just gets tangled most of the time, and when I finally do manage to hit a zombie with it it's more likely to not work than work. In order to stop myself from pulling my own hair out, I went to the forge again and got to work right away.\n\tWell, not right away, since I had to first clean the ash off the top of it again.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.sword.info.2=I infused the demon will-holding capabilities of the petty tartaric gem with an iron sword, and managed to create a blade that... was very dull and hardly did more damage than my fist. I was actually very disappointed with the outcome, because it took a long time of fiddling with the forge so that it would not overheat from the strain of using a petty tartaric gem as its power source.\n\tHowever, as soon as I picked up my Tartaric gem, the sword started to glow with a new energy. It seems that the higher the amount of demonic Will I have on my person, the more damage I seem to do with the sword as well as the more demon will that drops. Whenever you don't have a gem, the Will amount is very... miniscule.\n\tAfter a bit of testing I came to another realization: depending on what I kill, I receive different amounts of Will. It seems proportional to the amount of maximum health that the monster has - a spider, since it has a max health of 8 hearts gives 80%% the health of a zombie, which has 10 hearts. This is probably because these monsters require more Will to animate. I should keep this in mind for later.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.lesser.info.1=I was chatting with Tiberius today, discussing some of the projects that he is working on. I must say, when we start talking about his research it seems that he just keeps going on and on and on! Anyway, one of the recent inventions he wanted to talk about was his sigils: so far he managed to create a Water Sigil and a Lava Sigil, using the Hellfire Forge I finally constructed for him as a means to create them. I wasn't entirely sure how he actually made them - I knew he experimented by taking some ingredients and combining them inside of the forge using the tartaric gem as a catalyst, but I haven't actually seen him actively experimenting yet. Well, I got some insight finally as to what he uses that blasted ash for.\n\tLet's see if I can mimic what he said properly. Ahem. "By using the Demon Will contained inside of these gems to transmute the ingredients, a reaction occurs between things that normally don't do anything when combined. By harnessing this forced synergy, I am able to inscribe several arcane symbols in patterns that will direct the energy that I add myself to perform the desired task." Although it doesn't show well in writing, picture me saying this while pushing glasses up the bridge of my nose. I'm not sure if he's normally like this, but I swear he gets all... science-y when he explains things to me.\n\tAt any rate, he showed me how he created a Water Sigil by demonstrating it to me. After the, admittedly flashy, demonstration, he then got to the meat of the discussion. "When I try to replicate this process with some more advanced materials, it seems that the reagents tend to... explode when added to the alchemy array. They seem very unstable. My thinking is that the ingredients aren't getting properly fused together - perhaps there is not enough energy in the forge to fuse them properly."\n\tAfter thinking about this for a few minutes, I got to work - as I mentioned in a previous entry, I figured that a more powerful Tartaric gem would be required, but I still haven't figured out exactly how I could do this in an elegant way. So, I decided that a brute-force approach would be sufficient for this!
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.lesser.info.2=I took a block of lapis, block of redstone, and a diamond as well as an empty petty Tartaric gem that I had lying around - part of a past experiment that... didn't exactly go very well. All I can say about it is that I am surprised Magus can make holes in a solid concrete wall simply disappear. I then combined these four items in the Hellfire forge with a filled petty Tartaric gem to act as a power source - a minimum of 60 Will seems to be needed. After a bit of effort trying to find an optimal arrangement, I then set them together and watched as the empty Tartaric gem started to grow inside of the forge.\n\tJust as a side note, I tried using a block of gold instead of a diamond to grow the gem, but it seems that having another crystal structure was more beneficial.\n\tThis new, "Lesser Tartaric gem" seems to have a much larger capacity, able to hold a total of 256 raw Will. Hopefully this is enough to sate Tiberius's need for large amounts of Will for a while. But alas it seems that I will need to fill up this gem. Another long night is ahead of me!
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.reactions.info=I woke up in a hospital bed today, aching something fierce. I opened my eyes and saw the dull magenta that made up the ceiling of the "Intense Curse" wing of the hospital in Veteres, which is the closest major city to our village. I wasn't exactly worried by this information: it more so puzzled me that I somehow ended up here while seemingly only covered in scrapes and bruises, plus a simple cast on my left leg. Someone must have cast an "Ossa Fracta" curse on me or something, since all it could be was a simple broken bone! \n\tWhen Magus came in with one of the nurses with a solemn face, I knew it was something more drastic. Apparently, one of my experiments with the new Lesser Tartaric gem rebounded and created a small but forceful explosion. That much I could understand easily enough, but that wasn't it: the mixture of obsidian, iron and diamond that I used coated my lower left leg, forming into a rigid shell that couldn't be removed. The cast that I had on my leg wasn't actually a cast, but some form of runic matrix covering the light-blue shell. \n\tCalmly, I asked what Magus thought, even though I was pretty sure what had occurred. "I think," he said, giving a side-long glance towards the nurse that was listening intently before looking back at me, "that it is simply some sort of residue that is diamond-based, which is the main reason we can't remove it. It is also laced with a bit of... otherworldly energy, which is the main reason that you are here instead of a bed at the local clinic - the Conglomerate is rather stringent about unknown energy directly contacting people, ever since the Eldritch Incident, so we had to make sure that there wasn't any issues."\n\t"I see..." Normally Magus doesn't bother much with formalities such as making sure that the Conglomerate is informed about unknown energies - I've been experimenting with Demon Will for quite a while, and it isn't like the Conglomerate came knocking on our door to have this magic registered. I won't go into much detail here, since I am not well versed in politics, but I know that Magus partakes in it only sparingly. This meant that the power from this Will concerned Magus a lot, perhaps through some of his past dealings...?\n\t"Ah well, enough about that for now," Magus said, rolling up the sleeves of his robes. "I tried to break the shell when I first saw it, obviously after checking what it was. It didn't have an effect last time, but now..."\n\tThere was a searing heat on my left leg, accompanied by a blinding red light as Magus cupped his hands on top of the blue shell. After what felt like an eternity, but what must have been only a couple of seconds, the shell started to crack and fracture, falling apart. Honestly, it was kind of anticlimactic. \n\tI tried to get up, but Magus pushed me back into the bed with a small shove. "Bella, you need to stay and rest. You can work with your research on the gems later." I was initially annoyed, but that soon passed as I had a lot of time to think. The only reason that Magus wasn't able to do the exact same thing earlier was probably because I still had my Tartaric gem on my person after the explosion. So whatever happened to my leg had to be directly tied to the demon Will, and as soon as my gem was taken the shell was able to be removed. It got me thinking...
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.sentientGem.info.1=After a few days of some "well needed bed rest," prescribed and enforced by Magus, I decided to do a bit of research primarily on the sentient equipment that I have made so far. There is just so much that I do not know about the sentient sword as well as Demon Will in general. Sure, we know some of the theory, but considering that Magus and I were the ones that developed the theory in the first place it is hard to tell how accurate it is.\n\tFor this, I needed to get creative. Magus told me that whenever he takes an apprentice, he insists that they must learn another form of magic alongside the research that he is doing. Tiberius offered for me to learn Botany, but I scoffed at the idea - a bunch of flowers weren't going to help me much when fighting demons! 
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.sentientGem.info.2=The Sentient Armour Gem is a toggleable item that is used to equip and unequip your Sentient Armour. When you right-click with the gem while you have a minimum of 16 Demon Will in your inventory, your armour will be replaced with a set of Sentient Armour that copies all of the enchants from the armour that you replaced - when you activate the gem again, your original armour is returned to you. This also works when you have no armour on at all to begin with.\n\tThe Sentient Armour initially acts as a simple set of iron armour, yielding no additional abilities besides protection. Similarly to other sentient tools, however, the armour provides more protection when you have more Demon Will in your possession. This makes the protection provided really powerful when you have a large quantity of Demon Will accumulated. The downside to this is that every hit you take will syphon a small bit of Demon Will from your Tartaric gems, and if you get too low your armour will revert back to its original form. Could be bad!
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.routing.info=Item transport in Blood Magic comes from linking strands of Demonic Will between routing nodes, which act as conduits in order to transfer items from one inventory to another. To start off with, let us explain how each individual item works.\n\tEvery single routing system needs a Master Routing node, which acts as the brains of the system. An Input Routing node inputs items into your system, and an Output Routing node outputs items from your system, and a regular routing node doesn't have any special function.\n\tTo form a network, you need to shift-click a node with your Node Router and then shift click another node that you want to connect. This links the two nodes together. As long as a node can trace some form of route to another node (and if it is connected to a Master Routing node) they can "talk" to each other.\n\tAs a rule of thumb, items are pulled from an inventory next to an input node and are pushed into an inventory next to an output node. In order to set what goes where, a filter should be used. By clicking on one of the buttons in the node's interface you can select what goes into the inventory in the given direction (N indicates North, etc). If you place an Item Filter into the left-most slot of the node you can specify the quantities and types of items that the node may interact with based on the filter. If you set a filter on an input filter, you can only pull those types of items from the inventory (keeping at least the given amount if you specify a quantity). If you set a filter on an output filter, you can only push those types of items into the inventory, up to a max of the quantity specified.\n\tThere are four types of filters: \n\tPrecise - The item needs to be matched exactly, including NBT and metadata\n\tMod Item - The item matches if it is from one of the filered mods.\n\tIgnore NBT - The item filter does not take into account any NBT\n\tOre Dictionary - Any item that matches one of the ore dictionary references of the filters are allowed.\n\tThere are two numbers that you will be able to see when you insert the filter into the routing node: the quantity and the priority. When you click on one of the items in the filter, the name of the item you have selected will appear and right below that is the quantity of items. By setting this number you can tell the filter how many of this type of item it will keep in stock in the connected inventory (either filling to that amount if it is an output node or making sure it keeps that amount left in the inventory if it is an input node). If you decrease the filter's amount to 0, you can set so that the filter allows "Everything," as in any amount, for that particular filter. Input nodes will pull as much as it can from the inventory, and output nodes will push as much as possible.\n\tThe second number is the priority of the node, altered by the arrow buttons next to it. This number is different for each side of the node. The node that has the LOWER NUMBER in the network will be used first.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.aura.info=When an entity is killed normally, it evaporates over time and returns to the creator. When captured in a snare, it is pulled into this plane from the ethereal and is sort of stuck. We have, for all intents and purposes, broken its programming and it has frozen all action. When we burn it, it returns to an ethereal state and is able to resume normal operations. If this Will is injected into the air, we can then harness it in a variety of ways. Some of them are mundane in nature, whereas others are quite powerful.\n\tDemon Will when injected into the air stays within the chunk that it was put in without migrating. Each chunk has their own stored Will, with each type of Will stored individually (more on that in a different section). This Will can be accessed and manipulated by other blocks and items.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.types.info=So far, the only type of Demon Will that we have discussed is raw Will. As the name suggests, it is the most raw and unadulterated form of Will there is, but this does not mean that it is pure. In fact, Demon Will takes on many different forms: Raw is the type we deal with normally, but there is also Corrosive, Destructive, Vengeful, and Steadfast. Raw Will is composed of a mixture of all four of these types, and perhaps mixed with other as of yet undiscovered types, but once split into these different Will types it seems impossible to recombine them.\n\tIt is not clear yet whether these different types of Will come from different sources, however we do know the process of generating these different types of Will. When Will of the same type bump into each other in the Aura it tends to congregate similar to how impurities in an otherwise homogeneous liquid clump together. If a device is able to latch onto these clumps within the Raw Will in the Aura, chunks of pure Will of a particular type can be gathered. One such device is the Demon Crystallizer, whose entry can be found further down.\n\tEach of these four types of Will represent different aspects of one's desire. There may be more types of Will, however they are either not pure enough or simply cannot be created in this form.\n\tCorrosive represents the desire to break down all things around oneself, either with acid or by crushing force. One who can master this Will can wield debilitating status effects and are immune to horrible poisons.\n\tVengeful can be viewed as the desire to seek a target without tiring. Usually, this can be seen either as an increased speed of the body to seek their pray or to make sure that a target is not able to get away as you continually attack them.\n\tDestructive, as you can probably tell, is pure force. Attack strength and overall physical prowess can be gained if this Will is properly harnessed. It can also be used to crush and smash things when used in other applications.\n\tSteadfast is seen as the desire to prevent damage to oneself. In most cases, masters of this Will are the defensive bulwark of the party, able to withstand powerful attacks and not even feel it. If you need to stay alive, through your armour or by rituals, this is one choice that should be considered.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.crucible.info=The Demon Crucible is a device that is able to burn the Demon Will inside of a Tartaric Gem and other items in order to inject it into the Aura of the chunk that it is in. There are a few different ways to use the crucible: one of the simplest ways is to place a Tartaric Gem inside of the crucible by right clicking on it with a gem in your hand. The crucible will then in that case drain the Will from the gem until either the Aura is saturated with that type of Will (a max of 100 by default) or until the gem is empty.\n\tAnother mode is to use the contained Tartaric Gem to drain the Will from the Aura - this is done by applying a strong redstone signal to the crucible and then the contained gem will attempt to drain as much Will as possible.\n\tFinally, a discrete piece of Will can be burned in the crucible if there is enough room in the Aura of that type. One example of this is a Demon Will Crystal, which has a value of 50.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.crystallizer.info=As discussed previously, Demon Aura is the ethereal manifestation of Demon Will, and the substance obtained when killing a mob is its physical manifestation. The Demon Crystallizer acts as an anchoring point for Demon Will in the Aura to latch on to, transforming the ethereal Will back into a physical form once again in the form of a crystal.\n\tYou may be curious why you do not just take the Will from a Tartaric Gem directly and form a crystal from it. That is because by transforming the Will to its ethereal form we purify it and allow the Will to attempt to resume its normal operations - keep in mind that when we kill a monster with Demon Will attached to them, we freeze the programming of the Will so that it cannot do what it was sent out to do. By converting it into the ethereal form in the Aura, the Will becomes more active, and that is the Will that is grabbed by the crystallizer. Just don't look at it funny.\n\tIn order for the Demon Crystallizer to work it must be in a chunk with a high amount of Demon Will (80) of a particular type, and after a certain amount of time it will consume the Will from the Aura in order to create a Demon Crystal Cluster with a single spire. There are two ways for the Crystallizer to work: it can form a crystal from an aspected type of Will (Corrosive, Destructive, Vengeful, and Steadfast) if there is enough Will of that particular type, or it will take Raw Will from the Aura to create a crystal. \n\tWhen it generates a crystal from Raw Will, there is a small chance (~40%%) for the formed crystal to be of one of the aspected types. Essentially, this is how you can initially gather the different types of Will.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.cluster.info=The Demon Crystal Cluster can either be created by a Demon Crystallizer or by crafting one in the Hellfire Forge with Demon Will Crystals. Crafted clusters can be placed on any solid surface, such as the floor, walls, and ceilings. There are a max of seven spires on the crystal when fully grown, and when broken with a pickaxe it will drop the spires as Demon Will Crystals. However, if you right-click the cluster when you have a Tartaric Gem with more than 1024 Raw Will inside of it, you can break off a single spire from the cluster without breaking the cluster itself; this will never break the main spire from the cluster.\n\tWhen left to its own devices, the cluster will syphon some Will of the same type from the Aura to grow itself slowly. This process is a bit slow, but there is a minor net gain.\n\tThere are two rituals that are used to grow and harvest these crystals: the Gathering of the Forsaken Souls and the Crash of the Crystal. In order to find out how to use them, please refer to The Ritual Master.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.pylon.info=As you may know, Demon Aura remains in its own chunk if there are not any outside influences. Well, this is one of those influences. The Demon Pylon acts as a beacon for Will in the Aura, pulling the Will from neighbouring chunks (those chunks that are directly next to it in the four cardinal directions, not diagonal) into its chunk. The Pylon will attempt to equalize the Will in its chunk with its neighbour so that the Pylon's chunk has as much Will as its highest neighbour for each Will type. This process only happens one way, however: if the neighbouring chunk has less Will in it than the Pylon's chunk, the Will will not transfer the other direction.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.demon.gauge.info=In order to tell how much Will you have in a given chunk you need to have a Demon Will Gauge. When in your inventory, the gauge will display the Will in the chunk that you have in five bars in the top-left corner of the screen. You can tell how much there is exactly by shifting; numbers will appear to the right of the bars to give the amount rounded to the nearest whole number.

# Alchemy Entry Texts
guide.BloodMagic.entry.alchemy.intro.info=My name is Vlad Highborn, and I am a Blood Mage. I have studied the intricate workings of alchemy and the process of "Equivalent Exchange," which governs all aspects of magic. Basically, you cannot create something from nothing, although many have tried when searching for a particular stone. That obviously didn't end well, because people are clamoring for a fake variant even today. Of course simply saying that I am an alchemist isn't enough, because one of the main things I do is study Blood Magic with The Ritual Master and The Architect, both of whom have achieved those titles by their own merits. Magus and Tiberius have been busy recording their own works over the years, although I don't think Magus has everything written down in a book - I have yet to find any actual proof.\n\tMy book deals with all things alchemical in Blood Magic. From the uses of Arcane Ash to the intricate workings of the Alchemy Table, you will find everything you need to know about some of the more complex elements in the world. Not everything you need to know is in this book - for a full understanding about Blood Magic, you will need to read the other entries in this entire tome.\n\tBut for now, I hope you enjoy my research notes. You shan't find any lies between these covers.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.alchemy.ash.info=Arcane Ash is necessary in order to create alchemy arrays, powerful circles that are able to provide various effects. This ash is crafted using the Hellfire Forge and Demon Will, so if you are new to this concept please consult the "Demon Kin." \n\tThe ash has a total of twenty uses before you need to craft another. When you right click on the ground (or a wall, though it will only render one direction), you will inscribe a simple circle out of ash. If you click on the ash again with an item, it will be "placed inside of the ash" - assuming that this item is valid, the circle will change shape to represent that it is ready for the next item. If it doesn't change shape, then you did something wrong.\n\tOnce it has changed shape, you can then place in the secondary item. If this item matches with the first item, the circle will start rotating and performing different actions depending on the recipe it is working on. \n\tEvery non-crafting effect that can be performed using these arrays can be found in this book, and even if the recipe changes through 3rd party means it will show updated here. The items shown are the order they need to be placed in.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.alchemy.speed.info=The Movement Array creates a small vortex of air at its center and uses a small amount of energy to heat it up. After that, once an animal or any other type of entity walks into its area of effect, they will be launched forward in the direction that it was placed in by the force of the air. What is more, if fallen onto from a large height, the array will eliminate the fall damage that would have incurred. Just be prepared for some mild motion afterward. \n\tThe direction of motion is in the direction of the arrow on the array.\n\tIt should also be noted that you will gain a much greater distance if you fall or jump onto the array than if you simply walked into its area. This has to do with the turbulence from your movements causing a much greater reaction.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.alchemy.updraft.info=Using the exact same principles as the Movement Array, this array launches the entity that steps on top of it vertically in the air. Naturally, any user would have to be careful because the way down may be a little arduous!
guide.BloodMagic.entry.alchemy.bounce.info=By using a source of heat near its center that is pushed downward, the array attempts to soften the ground underneath it. After it has done this, it then converts carbon and hydrogen into a rubbery material inside of the earth. This combination causes any entity to impact the surface to bounce in the air and eliminating the fall damage that would otherwise be sustained. This bouncing can be stopped by simply shifting, and it will still cushion your fall.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.alchemy.turret.info=By utilizing the Demon Will that is still controlling a mob, you can take over the mind of a skeleton in order to make it do your bidding. If a skeleton finds itself inside of the area of this array, it will act as a sentry and attack hostile monsters nearby. Unfortunately this array is still highly experimental, so it may not work very well or consistently.
guide.BloodMagic.entry.alchemy.buff.info=Through rigorous study, you realize that alchemical arrays have a wide range of applications. So far, you have managed to create powerful items through crafting arrays, as well as a couple of arrays that provide functional benefits such as rapid movement and weak forms of teleportation. However, one of the uses that you have yet to tap into is providing powerful buffs through an active array.\n\t"Buff Arrays" are the general term for alchemy arrays that provide some buff to players within its area of effect. These areas of effect tends to have a very large radius which cannot be manipulated (unlike Rituals). However, because alchemy arrays have no concept of a Soul Network, they have to power their effects through other means: mainly through direct blood offerings. In simplified terms, this means that whenever the array will apply a buff, it will damage (take HP) from the player that it is cast on. \n\tBecause of the direct nature of these sacrifices, the HP -> buff conversion is a lot more favourable for players in the early game compared to similar buffs in the mod. For instance, if a buff from a sigil cost 100 LP for 10 seconds of activation, a more powerful buff can be applied by the array for 30 seconds for 1 HP (which is 100 LP in a T1 altar with no runes). This can be seen as a lot more efficient in the early tiers, while during the later tiers it is not as efficient of an effect. However, because of the stationary nature of the arrays, they will tend to provide a stronger effect than their sigil counter parts, so people may wish to still use it in the late-game. 
guide.BloodMagic.entry.alchemy.fastMiner.info=When tasked with carving out a large area of land, sometimes it is best to just do it by hand. For those occasions, this array is for you. The array applies a Haste III buff to players within a 10 block radius, costing the user 1 HP per 30 seconds. Because it is a general Haste buff, it will also increase your attack speed while in its area of effect, though you will have to be careful since other players will benefit from this too!
