As you start off with nothing but a handful of $(l:demon_will/soul_snare)Soul Snares$(), you'll find much of the mod is closed off to you. Eventually, we hope to include a tutorial and some level of tiering in the book, but as the mod is still in early Alpha for 1.16, we have decided to list things out here as best we can."
