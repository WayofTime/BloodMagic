It may seem weak at first, but it is powered by the Wills you carry, so crafting a $(l:demon_will/soul_gem)Tartaric Gem$() is a must. $(br2) Note that the sword, as with all $(l:demon_will/sentient_tools)Sentient Tools$(), can be repaired with $(l:demon_will/crystallized_will)Crystallized Will$() in an Anvil."
