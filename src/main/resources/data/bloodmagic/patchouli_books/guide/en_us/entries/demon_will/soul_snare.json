Kill them quickly and you should get a $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/demon_will)Demon Will$(). Before you ask, yes, the Looting enchantment will improve your odds. Once you've gathered a couple, you can get to work on crafting yourself a $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/sentient_sword)Sentient Sword$() and a $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/soul_gem)Tartaric Gem$() - these will make collecting $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/demon_will)Demon Will$() much easier."
