	uses its life essence to feed the demonic will crystals inside of its area (two blocks above the ritual stone, 7x7 region and 5 high). This costs LP and 
	demonic will from the aura of the particular type, and costs less will the more... varied the mobs killed are. Growth amount is dictated by the max health
	of the mobs killed.

- Fixed path blocks so they are actually craftable.
- Added gui stuff to enable priority in the item routing system: nodes with a lower value priority will be accessed first. (May be rotated in the future)
- Grayed out the currently active side's button in the item routers.
- Added Demon Pylon
- Changed behaviour of Demon Crucible
- Fully implemented the behaviour of the crystal growing process.
	- A Demon Crucible will be able to syphon the demon will from the tartaric gems inside of its inventory - right click with a gem to place it into the inventory.
	- The syphoned will from the gem will go into the chunk, staying in the air - it will not move to neighbouring chunks unless forced to do so through other means
	- The Demon Pylon draws will in the air from surrounding chunks and puts it into its own chunk - this acts as sort of like a pressure system, where it will even out the will distribution, but only goes one way.
	- The Demon Crystallizer takes 100 will from the air (need a demon crucible for it to work) and forms a demon crystal on top of it. There is a 10% chance that this crystal will be of a special type.
	- The Demon Crystals can be mined in order to collect their crystals. These crystals can be used for crafting more powerful stuff. If you have over 1024 will on your person when you right click the crystal, you can harvest a single crystal instead of the entire thing.
	- You can put the harvested crystals inside of a demon crucible. Each crystal is worth 10 will, so this acts as a way to semi-automate will creation.
	- When a hellfire forge is inside of a chunk with demon will, it will fill its contained tartaric gem with will.
	- Changed a few recipes (like the greater tartaric gem) to match this new system.

Version 2.0.0
------------------------------------------------------

Initial release of the open beta for the mod to Minecraft v1.8.9! This mod version has a lot of changes. Because it is a full-on rewrite, some of the mechanics of the mod have changed/are going to change. As such, the feel of the mod will be slightly different than previous iterations.
This mod has a large amount of compatibility with the recipe look-up mod, Just Enough Items (JEI). It is VERY much recommended that you download JEI, since it will make your life a lot easier with the new mechanics.
Because this is a beta of a rewrite, there will be a lot of missing content. I am trying my hardest to add new content as fast as I can, but my team and I are only human and can only code so fast. Please give a little patience while we make the mod the best it possibly can!
Also, please submit bug reports or feature requests to the github, https://github.com/WayofTime/BloodMagic. We'll get to the issue soon!

New
- Added "Alchemy Array" crafting - this is achieved by making some "Arcane Ash" and clicking on the ground to create an array. You then click on the array with the first ingredient and then the second - breaking the array will give the items back.
- Added JEI compatibility
- Added WAILA compatibility (No more needing 3rd-party addons!)

Changed
- Lots of internals have changed. Too many to list.
- A graphical overhaul of everything has been implemented. These textures were provided by CyanideX's Unity texture pack. BBoldt and Yulife (Inap) from the Unity team are our new permanent texture artists.

Bug Fixes
-
